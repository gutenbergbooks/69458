</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>There</span> once lived in the woods an old rabbit
gentleman named Uncle Wiggily Longears, and
in the hollow-stump bungalow where he had his
home there also lived Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy,
a muskrat lady housekeeper. Near Uncle Wiggily
there were, in hollow trees, or in nests or in
burrows under the ground, many animal friends
of his—rabbits, squirrels, puppy dogs, pussy
cats, frogs, ducks, chickens and others, so that
Uncle Wiggily and Nurse Jane were never
lonesome.</p>

<p class='c011'>Often Sammie or Susie Littletail, a small boy
and girl rabbit, would hop over to the hollow-stump
bungalow, and call:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Uncle Wiggily! Uncle Wiggily! Can’t
you come out and play with us?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the old rabbit gentleman, who was as
fond of fun as a kitten, would put on his tall silk
hat, take his red, white and blue-striped barber-pole
rheumatism crutch, that Nurse Jane had
gnawed for him out of a corn-stalk, and he
would go out to play with the rabbit children,
about whom I have told you in other books.</p>

<p class='c011'>Or perhaps Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, the
squirrel boys, might ask Uncle Wiggily to go
after hickory nuts with them, or maybe Lulu,
Alice or Jimmie Wibblewobble, the duck children,
would want their bunny uncle to see them
go swimming.</p>

<p class='c011'>So, altogether, Uncle Wiggily had a good
time in his hollow-stump bungalow which was
built in the woods. When he had nothing else
to do Mr. Longears would go for a ride in his
airship. This was made of a clothes-basket, with
toy circus balloons on it to make it rise up above
the trees. Or Uncle Wiggily might take a trip
in his automobile, which had big bologna sausages
on the wheels for tires. And whenever the
rabbit gentleman wanted the automobile wheels
to go around faster he sprinkled pepper on the
sausages.</p>

<p class='c011'>One day Uncle Wiggily said to Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think I will go for a ride in my airship.
Is there anything I can bring from the store
for you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, you might bring a loaf of bread and
a pound of sugar,” answered the muskrat lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very good,” answered Uncle Wiggily, and
then he took some soft cushions out to put in
the clothes-basket part of his airship, so, in case
the air popped out of the balloons, and he fell,
he would land easy like, and soft.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon the rabbit gentleman was sailing off
through the air, over the tree tops, his paws in
nice, warm red mittens that Nurse Jane had
knitted for him. For it was winter, you see, and
Uncle Wiggily’s paws would have been cold
steering his airship, by the baby carriage wheel
which guided it, had it not been for the mittens.</p>

<p class='c011'>It did not take the bunny uncle long to go to
the store in his airship, and soon, with the loaf
of bread and pound of sugar under the seat,
away he started for his hollow-stump bungalow
again.</p>

<p class='c011'>And, as he sailed on and over the tree tops,
Uncle Wiggily looked far off, and he saw some
black smoke rising in the air.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! That smoke seems to be near my hollow-stump
bungalow,” he said to himself. “I
guess Nurse Jane is starting a fire in the kitchen
stove to get dinner. I must hurry home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily made his airship go faster, and
then he saw, coming toward him, a big bird,
with large wings.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, that looks just like my old friend,
Grandfather Goosey Gander,” Uncle Wiggily
thought to himself. “I wonder why he is flying
so high? He hardly ever goes up so near the
clouds.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And he seems to have some one on his back,”
spoke Uncle Wiggily out loud this time, sort of
talking to the loaf of bread and the pound of
sugar. “A lady, too,” went on the bunny uncle.
“A lady with a tall hat on, something like mine,
only hers comes to a point on top. And she has
a broom with her. I wonder who it can be?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And when the big white bird came nearer to
the airship Uncle Wiggily saw that it was not
Grandfather Goosey Gander at all, but another
big gander, almost like his friend, whom he
often went to see. And then the bunny uncle
saw who it was on the bird’s back.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, it’s Mother Goose!” cried Uncle
Wiggily Longears. “It’s Mother Goose! She
looks just like her pictures in the book, too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I am Mother Goose,” said the lady who
was riding on the back of the big, white gander,
spoke Mr. Longears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am glad to meet you, Mother Goose, I have often heard
about you. I can see, over the tree tops, that
Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, my muskrat lady
housekeeper, is getting dinner ready. I can tell
by the smoke. Will you not ride home with me?
I will make my airship go slowly, so as not
to get ahead of you and your fine gander-goose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alas, Uncle Wiggily,” said Mother Goose,
scratching her chin with the end of the broom
handle, “I cannot come home to dinner with
you much as I would like it. Alas! Alas!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why not?” asked the bunny uncle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because I have bad news for you,” said
Mother Goose. “That smoke, which you saw
over the tree tops, was not smoke from your
chimney as Nurse Jane was getting dinner.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What was it then?” asked Uncle Wiggily,
and a cold shiver sort of ran up and down between
his ears, even if he did have warm, red
mittens on his paws. “What was that smoke?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The smoke from your burning bungalow,”
went on Mother Goose. “It caught fire, when
Nurse Jane was getting dinner, and now——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! Don’t tell me Nurse Jane is burned!”
cried Uncle Wiggily. “Don’t say that!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was not going to,” spoke Mother Goose,
kindly. “But I must tell you that your hollow-stump
bungalow is burned to the ground.
There is nothing left but some ashes,” and she
made the gander, on whose back she was riding,
fly close alongside of Uncle Wiggily’s airship.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My nice bungalow burned!” exclaimed the
rabbit gentleman. “Well, I am very, very sorry
for that. But still it might be worse. Nurse
Jane might have been hurt, and that would have
been quite too bad. I dare say I can get another
bungalow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is what I came to tell you about,” said
Mother Goose. “I was riding past when I saw
your Woodland hollow-stump house on fire, and
I went down to see if I could help. It was too
late to save the bungalow, but I said I would find
a place for you and Nurse Jane to stay to-night,
or as long as you like, until you can build a new
home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is very kind of you,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“I hardly know what to do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have many friends,” went on Mother
Goose. “You may have read about them in
the book which tells of me. Any of my friends
would be glad to have you come and live with
them. There is the Old Woman Who Lives in
a Shoe, for instance.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But hasn’t she so many children she doesn’t
know what to do?” asked Uncle Wiggily, as he
remembered the story in the book.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” answered Mother Goose, “she has. I
suppose you would not like it there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I like children,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“But if there are so many that the dear Old Lady
doesn’t know what to do, she wouldn’t know
what to do with Nurse Jane and me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, you might go stay with my friend Old
Mother Hubbard,” said Mother Goose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But if I went there, would not the cupboard
be bare?” asked Uncle Wiggily, “and what
would Nurse Jane and I do for something to
eat?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s so,” spoke Mother Goose, as she
reached up quite high and brushed a cobweb off
the sky with her broom. “That will not do,
either. I must see about getting Mother Hubbard
and her dog something to eat. You can
stay with her later. Oh, I have it!” suddenly
cried the lady who was riding on the back of the
white gander, “you can go stay with Old King
Cole! He’s a jolly old soul!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily shook his head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you very much, Mother Goose,” he
said, slowly. “But Old King Cole might send
for his fiddlers three, and I do not believe I
would like to listen to jolly music to-day when
my nice bungalow has just burned down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, perhaps not,” agreed Mother Goose.
“Well, if you can find no other place to stay to-night
come with me. I have a big house, and
with me live Little Bo Peep, Little Boy Blue,
who is getting to be quite a big chap now, Little
Tommie Tucker and Jack Sprat and his wife.
Oh, I have many other friends living with me,
and surely we can find room for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” answered Uncle Wiggily. “I
will think about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he flew down in his airship to the place
where the hollow-stump bungalow had been, but
it was not there now. Mother Goose flew down
with her gander after Uncle Wiggily. They
saw a pile of blackened and smoking wood, and
near it stood Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the
muskrat lady, and many other animals who lived
in Woodland with Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I am so sorry!” cried Nurse Jane. “It
is my fault. I was baking a pudding in the oven,
Uncle Wiggily. I left it a minute while I ran
over to the pen of Mrs. Wibblewobble, the duck
lady, to ask her about making a new kind of carrot
sauce for the pudding, and when I came
home the pudding had burned, and the bungalow
was on fire.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind,” spoke Uncle Wiggily, kindly,
“as long as you were not burned yourself, Nurse
Jane.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But where will you sleep to-night?” asked
the muskrat lady, sorrowfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh,” began Uncle Wiggily, “I guess I
can——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come stay with us!” cried Sammie and
Susie Littletail, the rabbit children.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Or with us!” invited Johnnie and Billie
Bushytail, the squirrels.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And why not with us?” asked Nannie and
Billie Wagtail, the goat children.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’d ask you to come with us,” said Jollie
and Jillie Longtail, the mouse children, “only
our house is so small.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Many of Uncle Wiggily’s friends, who had
hurried up to see the hollow-stump bungalow
burn, while he was at the store, now, in turn, invited
him to stay with them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I, myself, have asked him to come with me,”
said Mother Goose, “or with any of my friends.
We all would be glad to have him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is very kind of you,” said the rabbit gentleman.
“And this is what I will do, until I can
build me a new bungalow. I will take turns
staying at your different hollow-tree homes, your
nests or your burrows underground. And I will
come and visit you also, Mother Goose, and all
of your friends; at least such of them as have
room for me.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that is what I’ll do. I’ll visit around
now that my hollow-stump home is burned. I
thank you all. Come, Nurse Jane, we will pay
our first visit to Sammie and Susie Littletail, the
rabbits.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And while the other animals hopped, skipped
or flew away through the woods, and as Mother
Goose sailed off on the back of her gander, to
sweep more cobwebs out of the sky, Uncle Wiggily
and Nurse Jane went to the Littletail burrow,
or underground house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good-bye, Uncle Wiggily!” called Mother
Goose. “I’ll see you again, soon, sometime.
And if ever you meet with any of my friends,
Little Jack Horner, Bo Peep, or the three little
pigs, about whom you may have read in my
book, be kind to them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will,” promised Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>And he did, as you may read in the next chapter,
when, if the sugar spoon doesn’t tickle the
carving knife and make it dance on the bread
board, the story will be about Uncle Wiggily
and the first little pig.</p>

  <h2 id='Ch-II' class='c013'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE FIRST PIG</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily Longears</span>, the nice old gentleman
rabbit, came out of the underground
burrow house of the Littletail family, where he
was visiting a while with the bunny children,
Sammie and Susie, because his own hollow-stump
bungalow had burned down.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where are you going, Uncle Wiggily?”
asked Sammie Littletail, the rabbit boy, as he
strapped his cabbage leaf books together, ready
to go to school.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I am just going for a little walk,” answered
Uncle Wiggily. “Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper, asked
me to get her some court plaster from the five
and six-cent store, and on my way there I may
have an adventure. Who knows?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are going to school,” said Susie. “Will
you walk part of the way with us, Uncle Wiggily?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To be sure I will!” crowed the old gentleman
rabbit, making believe he was Mr. Cock
A. Doodle, the rooster.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Uncle Wiggily, with Sammie and Susie,
started off across the snow-covered fields and
through the woods. Pretty soon they came to
the path the rabbit children must take to go to
the hollow-stump school, where the lady mouse
teacher would hear their carrot and turnip
gnawing lessons.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good-by, Uncle Wiggily!” called Sammie
and Susie. “We hope you have a nice adventure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good-by. Thank you, I hope I do,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the rabbit gentleman walked on, while
Sammie and Susie hurried to school, and pretty
soon Mr. Longears heard a queer grunting noise
behind some bushes near him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!” came the sound.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hello! Who is there?” asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, if you please, I am here, and I am the
first little pig,” came the answer, and out from
behind the bush stepped a cute little piggie boy,
with a bundle of straw under his paw.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So you are the first little pig, eh?” asked
Uncle Wiggily. “How many of you are there
altogether?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Three, if you please,” grunted the first little
pig. “I have two brothers, and they are the
second and third little pigs. Don’t you remember
reading about us in the Mother Goose
book?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, of course I do!” cried Uncle Wiggily,
twinkling his nose. “And so you are the first
little pig. But what are you going to do with
that bundle of straw?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m going to build me a house, Uncle Wiggily,
of course,” grunted the piggie boy.
“Don’t you remember what it says in the book?
‘Once upon a time there were three little pigs,
named Grunter, Squeaker and Twisty-Tail.’
Well, I’m Grunter, and I met a man with a load
of straw, and I asked him for a bundle to make
me a house. He very kindly gave it to me, and
now, I’m off to build it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“May I come?” asked Uncle Wiggily. “I’ll
help you put up your house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course you may come—glad to have
you,” answered the first little pig. “Only you
know what happens to me; don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No! What?” asked the rabbit gentleman.
“I guess I have forgotten the story.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, after I build my house of straw, just
as it says in the Mother Goose story book, along
comes a bad old wolf, and he blows it down,”
said the first little pig.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, how dreadful!” cried Uncle Wiggily,
“but maybe he won’t come to-day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, he will,” said the first little pig.
“It’s that way in the book, and the wolf has to
come.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, if he does,” said Uncle Wiggily,
“maybe I can save you from him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I hope you can!” grunted Grunter.
“It is no fun to be chased by a wolf.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the rabbit gentleman and the piggie boy
went on and on, until they came to the place
where Grunter was to build his house of straw.
Uncle Wiggily helped, and soon it was finished.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, it is real nice and cozy in here,” said
Uncle Wiggily, when he had made a big pile
of snow back of the straw house to keep off the
north wind, and had gone in with the little piggie
boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, it is cozy enough,” spoke Grunter,
“but wait until the bad wolf comes. Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maybe he won’t come,” said the rabbit,
hopeful like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, he will!” cried Grunter. “Here he
comes now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And, surely enough, looking out of the window,
the piggie boy and Uncle Wiggily saw a
bad wolf running over the snow toward them.
The wolf knocked on the door of the straw
house and cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Little pig! Little pig! Let me come in.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No! No! By the hair of my chinny-chin-chin.
I will not let you in!” answered Grunter,
just like in the book.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I’ll puff and I’ll blow, and I’ll blow
your house in!” howled the wolf. Then he
puffed and he blew, and, all of a sudden, over
went the straw house. But, just as it was falling
down, Uncle Wiggily cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quick, Grunter, come with me! I’ll dig
a hole for us in the pile of snow that I made back
of your house and in there we’ll hide where the
wolf can’t find us!” Then the rabbit gentleman,
with his strong paws, just made for digging, burrowed
a hole in the snow-bank, and as the straw
house toppled down, into this hole he crawled
with Grunter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now I’ve got you!” cried the wolf, as he
blew down the first little pig’s straw house. But
when the wolf looked he couldn’t see Grunter
or Uncle Wiggily at all, because they were hiding
in the snow-bank.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, well!” howled the wolf. “This isn’t
like the book at all! Where is that little pig?”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the wolf could not find Grunter, and soon
the bad creature went away, fearing to catch
cold in his eyes. Then Uncle Wiggily and
Grunter came out of the snow-bank and were
safe, and Uncle Wiggily took Grunter home to
the rabbit house to stay until Mother Goose
came, some time afterward, to get the first little
pig boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you very much, Uncle Wiggily,”
said Mother Goose, “for being kind to one of
my friends.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pray don’t mention it. I had a fine adventure,
besides saving a little pig,” said the rabbit
gentleman. “I wonder what will happen to
me to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And we shall soon see for, if the snowball
doesn’t wrap itself up in the parlor rug to hide
away from the jam tart, when it comes home
from the moving pictures, I’ll tell you next about
Uncle Wiggily and the second little pig.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='Ch-III' class='c013'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE SECOND PIG</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>There</span>! It’s all done!” exclaimed Nurse
Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the nice muskrat lady
housekeeper, who, with Uncle Wiggily Longears,
the rabbit gentleman, was staying in the
Littletail rabbit house, since the hollow-stump
bungalow had burned down.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s all done?” asked Uncle Wiggily,
looking over the tops of his spectacles.</p>

<p class='c011'>“These jam tarts I baked for Billie and Nannie
Wagtail, the goat children,” said Nurse Jane.
“Will you take them with you when you go
out for a walk, Uncle Wiggily, and leave them
at the goat house?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I most certainly will,” said the rabbit gentleman,
very politely. “Is there anything else I can
do for you, Nurse Jane?”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the muskrat lady wanted nothing more,
and, wrapping up the jam tarts in a napkin so
they would not catch cold, she gave them to Mr.
Longears to take to the two goat children.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily was walking along, wondering
what sort of an adventure he would have that
day, or whether he would meet Mother Goose
again, when all at once he heard a voice speaking
from behind some bushes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I think I will build my house here,” the
voice said. “The wolf is sure to find me anyhow,
and I might as well have it over with. I’ll
make my house here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily looked over the bushes, and
there he saw a funny little animal boy, with some
pieces of wood on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hello!” cried Uncle Wiggily, making his
nose twinkle in a most jilly-jolly way. “Who
are you, and what are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, I am Squeaker, the second little pig,
and I am going to make a house of wood,” was
the answer. “Don’t you remember how it reads
in the Mother Goose book? ‘Once upon a time
there were three little pigs, named Grunter,
Squeaker and——’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, I remember!” Uncle Wiggily said.
“I met your brother Grunter yesterday, and
helped him build his straw house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was kind of you,” spoke Squeaker. “I
suppose the bad old wolf got him, though. Too
bad! Well, it can’t be helped, as it is that way
in the book.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily didn’t say anything about
having saved Grunter, for he wanted to surprise
Squeaker, so the rabbit gentleman just twinkled
his nose again and asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“May I have the pleasure of helping you
build your house of wood?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed you may, thank you,” said Squeaker.
“I suppose the old wolf will be along soon, so
we had better hurry to get the house finished.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the second little pig and Uncle Wiggily
built the wooden house. When it was almost
finished Uncle Wiggily went out near the back
door, and began piling up some cakes of ice to
make a sort of box.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are you doing?” asked Squeaker.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’m just making a place where I can put
these jam tarts I have for Nannie and Billie
Wagtail,” the rabbit gentleman answered. “I
don’t want the wolf to get them when he blows
down your house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” sighed Squeaker. “I rather
wish, now, he didn’t have to blow over my nice
wooden house, and get me. But he has to, I
s’pose, ’cause it’s in the book.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Still, Uncle Wiggily didn’t say anything, but
he just sort of blinked his eyes and twinkled his
pink nose, until, all of a sudden, Squeaker looked
across the snowy fields, and he cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here comes the bad old wolf now!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And, surely enough, along came the growling,
howling creature. He ran up to the second
little pig’s wooden house, and, rapping on the
door with his paw, cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Little pig! Little pig! Let me come in!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no! By the hair on my chinny-chin-chin
I will not let you in,” said the second little
pig, bravely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I’ll puff and I’ll blow, and I’ll puff
and I’ll blow, and blow your house in!” howled
the wolf.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he puffed out his cheeks, and he took a
long breath and he blew with all his might and
main and suddenly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Cracko!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Down went the wooden house of the second
little piggie, and only that Uncle Wiggily and
Squeaker jumped to one side they would have
been squashed as flat as a pancake, or even two
pancakes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quick!” cried the rabbit gentleman in the
piggie boy’s ear. “This way! Come with me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where are we going?” asked Squeaker, as
he followed the rabbit gentleman over the
cracked and broken boards, which were all that
was left of the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are going to the little cabin that I made
out of cakes of ice, behind your wooden house,”
said Uncle Wiggily. “I put the jam tarts in it,
but there is also room for us, and we can hide
there until the bad wolf goes off.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, that isn’t the way it is in the book,” said
the second little pig. “But——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No matter!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“Hurry!” So he and Squeaker hid in the ice
cabin back of the blown-down house, and when
the bad wolf came poking along among the
broken boards, to get the little pig, he couldn’t
find him. For Uncle Wiggily had closed the
door of the ice place, and as it was partly covered
with snow the wolf could not see through.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” howled the wolf. “That’s twice
I’ve been fooled by those pigs! It isn’t like the
book at all. I wonder where he can have
gone?”</p>

<p class='c011'>But he could not find Squeaker or Uncle Wiggily
either, and finally the wolf’s nose became so
cold from sniffing the ice that he had to go home
to warm it, and so Uncle Wiggily and Squeaker
were safe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I don’t know how to thank you,” said
the second little piggie boy as the rabbit gentleman
took him home to Mother Goose, after having
left the jam tarts at the home of the Wagtail
goats.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pray do not mention it,” spoke Uncle Wiggily,
modest like, and shy. “It was just an adventure
for me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He had another adventure the following day,
Uncle Wiggily did. And if the dusting brush
doesn’t go swimming in the soap dish, and get
all lather so that it looks like a marshmallow
cocoanut cake, I’ll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and the third little pig.</p>

  <h2 id='Ch-IV' class='c013'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE THIRD PIG</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily Longears</span> sat in the burrow,
or house under the ground, where he and Nurse
Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady, lived with
the Littletail family of rabbits since the hollow-stump
bungalow had burned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” sounded a grunting, woofing
sort of voice over near one window.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” squealed another voice from under
the table.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, well! What is the matter with you
two piggie boys?” asked Uncle Wiggily, as he
took down from the sideboard his red, white and
blue barber-pole striped rheumatism crutch that
Nurse Jane had gnawed for him out of a corn-stalk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s the trouble, Grunter and Squeaker?”
asked the rabbit gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are lonesome for our brother,” said the
two little piggie boys No. 1 and No. 2. “We
want to see Twisty-Tail.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For the first and second little pigs, after having
been saved by Uncle Wiggily, and taken
home to Mother Goose, had come back to pay a
visit to the bunny gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, perhaps I may meet Twisty-Tail when
I go walking to-day,” spoke Uncle Wiggily.
“If I do I’ll bring him home with me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, goodie!” cried Grunter and Squeaker.
For they were the first and second little pigs, you
see. Uncle Wiggily had saved Grunter from
the bad wolf when the growling creature blew
down Grunter’s straw house. And, in almost
the same way, the bunny uncle had saved
Squeaker, when his wooden house was blown
over by the wolf. But Twisty-Tail, the third
little pig, Uncle Wiggily had not yet helped.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll look for Twisty-Tail to-day,” said the
rabbit gentleman as he started off for his adventure
walk, which he took every afternoon and
morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>On and on went Uncle Wiggily Longears
over the snow-covered fields and through the
wood, until just as he was turning around the
corner near an old red stump, the rabbit gentleman
heard a clinkity-clankity sort of a noise, and
the sound of whistling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! Some one is happy!” thought the
bunny uncle. “That’s a good sign—whistling.
I wonder who it is?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked around the stump corner and he
saw a little animal chap, with blue rompers on,
and a fur cap stuck back of his left ear, and this
little animal chap was whistling away as merrily
as a butterfly eating butterscotch candy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, that must be the third little pig!” exclaimed
Uncle Wiggily. “Hello!” called the
rabbit gentleman. “Are you Twisty-Tail?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s my name,” answered the little pig,
“and, as you see, I am building my house of
bricks, just as it tells about in the Mother Goose
book.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And, surely enough, Twisty-Tail was building
a little house of red bricks, and it was the tap-tap-tapping
of his trowel, or mortar-shovel, that
made the clinkity-clankity noise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you know me, Uncle Wiggily?” asked
the piggie boy. “You see I am in a book.
‘Once upon a time there were three little pigs,
and——’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know all about you,” interrupted Uncle
Wiggily. “I have met Mother Goose, and also
your two brothers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They didn’t know how to build the right
kind of houses, and so the wolf got them,” said
Twisty-Tail. “I am sorry, but it had to happen
that way, just as it is in the book.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily smiled, but said nothing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I met a man with a load of bricks, and I
begged some of them to build my house,” said
Twisty-Tail. “No wolf can get me. No,
sir-ee! I’ll build my house very strong, not weak
like my brothers’. No, indeed!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll help you build your house,” offered
Uncle Wiggily, kindly, and just as he and
Twisty-Tail finished the brick house and put
on the roof it began to rain and freeze.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We are through just in time,” said Twisty-Tail,
as he and the rabbit gentleman hurried inside.
“I don’t believe the wolf will come out in
such weather.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But just as he said that and looked from the
window, the little piggie boy gave a cry, and
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, here comes the bad animal now! But
he can’t get in my house, or blow it over, ’cause
the book says he didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The wolf came up through the freezing rain
and knocking on the third piggie boy’s brick
house, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Little pig! Little pig! Let me come in!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No! No! By the hair of my chinny-chin-chin,
I will not let you in!” grunted Twisty-Tail.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I’ll puff and I’ll blow, and I’ll blow
your house in!” howled the wolf.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You can’t! The book says so!” laughed the
little pig. “My house is a strong, brick one.
You can’t get me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just you wait!” growled the wolf. So he
puffed out his cheeks, and he blew and he blew,
but he could not blow down the brick house, because
it was so strong.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’m in no hurry,” the wolf said. “I’ll
sit down and wait for you to come out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the wolf sat down on his tail to wait outside
the brick house. After a while Twisty-Tail began
to get hungry.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you bring anything to eat, Uncle Wiggily?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I didn’t,” answered the rabbit gentleman.
“But if the old wolf would go away I’d
take you where your two brothers are visiting
with me in the Littletail family rabbit house and
you could have all you want to eat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the wolf would not go away, even when
Uncle Wiggily asked him to, most politely, making
a bow and twinkling his nose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m going to stay here all night,” the wolf
growled. “I am not going away. I am going
to get that third little pig!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you? Well, we’ll see about that!” cried
the rabbit gentleman. Then he took a rib out of
his umbrella, and with a piece of his shoe lace
(that he didn’t need) for a string he made a bow
like the Indians used to have.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I only had an arrow now I could shoot it
from my umbrella-bow, hit the wolf on the nose
and make him go away,” said Uncle Wiggily.
Then he looked out of the window and saw
where the rain, dripping from the roof, had
frozen into long, sharp icicles.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “An icicle
will make the best kind of an arrow! Now I’ll
shoot the wolf, not hard enough to hurt him, but
just hard enough to make him run away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Reaching out the window Uncle Wiggily
broke off a sharp icicle. He put this ice arrow
in his bow and, pulling back the shoe string,
“twang!” he shot the wolf on the nose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, wow! Oh, double-wow! Oh, custard
cake!” howled the wolf. “This isn’t in the
Mother Goose book at all. Not a single pig did
I get! Oh, my nose! Ouch!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he ran away, and Uncle Wiggily and
Twisty-Tail could come safely out of the brick
house, which they did, hurrying home to the
bunny house where Grunter and Squeaker were,
to get something to eat. So everything came out
right, you see, and Uncle Wiggily saved the
three little pigs, one after the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>And if the canary bird doesn’t go swimming
in the rice pudding, and eat out all the raisin
seeds, so none is left for the parrot, I’ll tell you
next of Uncle Wiggily and Little Boy Blue.</p>

  <h2 id='Ch-V' class='c013'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND LITTLE BOY BLUE</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily</span>, are you very busy to-day?”
asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat
lady housekeeper, who, with the old rabbit gentleman,
was on a visit to the Bushytail family of
squirrels in their hollow-tree home.</p>

<p class='c011'>After staying a while with the Littletail rabbits,
when his hollow-stump bungalow had
burned down, the bunny uncle went to visit
Johnnie and Billie Bushytail.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you very busy, Uncle Wiggily?” asked
the muskrat lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, no, Nurse Jane, not so very,” answered
the bunny uncle. “Is there something
you would like me to do for you?” he asked,
with a polite bow.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p038.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Mrs. Bushytail and I have just baked
some pies,” said the muskrat lady, “and we
thought perhaps you might like to take one to
your friend, Grandfather Goosey Gander.”
“Fine!” cried Uncle Wiggily, making his
nose twinkle like a star on a Christmas tree
in the dark. “Grandpa Goosey will be glad
to get a pie. I’ll take him one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have it all ready for you,” said Mrs.
Bushytail, the squirrel mother of Johnnie and
Billie, as she came in the sitting-room. “It’s a
nice hot pie, and it will keep your paws warm,
Uncle Wiggily, as you go over the ice and snow
through the woods and across the fields.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fine!” cried the bunny uncle again. “I’ll
get ready and go at once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily put on his warm fur coat, fastened
his tall silk hat on his head, with his ears
sticking up through holes cut in the brim, so it
would not blow off, and then, taking his red,
white and blue-striped rheumatism crutch, that
Nurse Jane had gnawed for him out of a corn-stalk,
away he started. He carried the hot apple
pie in a basket over his paw.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Grandpa Goosey will surely like this pie,”
said Uncle Wiggily to himself, as he lifted the
napkin that was over it to take a little sniff. “It
makes me hungry myself. And how nice and
warm it is,” he went on, as he put one cold paw
in the basket to warm it; warm his paw I mean,
not the basket.</p>

<p class='c011'>Over the fields and through the woods hopped
the bunny uncle. It began to snow a little, but
Uncle Wiggily did not mind that, for he was
well wrapped up.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he was about halfway to Grandpa
Goosey’s house Uncle Wiggily heard, from behind
a pile of snow, a sad sort of crying voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hello!” exclaimed the bunny uncle, “that
sounds like some one in trouble. I must see if
I can help them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily looked over the top of the pile
of snow, and, sitting on the ground, in front of
a big icicle, was a boy all dressed in blue. Even
his eyes were blue, but you could not very well
see them, as they were filled with tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” said Uncle Wiggily,
kindly. “This is quite too bad! What is the
matter, little fellow; and who are you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am Little Boy Blue, from the home of
Mother Goose,” was the answer, “and the matter
is that it’s lost!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is lost?” asked Uncle. “If it’s a
penny I will help you find it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It isn’t a penny,” answered Boy Blue. “It’s
the hay stack which I have to sleep under. I
can’t find it, and I must see where it is or else
things won’t be as they are in the Mother Goose
book. Don’t you know what it says?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And he sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Little Boy Blue, come blow your horn,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>There are sheep in the meadow and cows in the corn.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Where’s Little Boy Blue, who looks after the sheep?</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Why he’s under the hay stack, fast asleep.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“Only I can’t go to sleep under the hay stack,
Uncle Wiggily, because I can’t find it. And, oh,
dear! I don’t know what to do!” and Little Boy
Blue cried harder than ever, so that some of his
tears froze into little round marbles of ice, like
hail stones.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, there, now!” said Uncle Wiggily,
kindly. “Of course you can’t find a hay stack
in the winter. They are all covered with snow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are they?” asked Boy Blue, real surprised
like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course, they are!” cried Uncle Wiggily,
in his most jolly voice. “Besides, you wouldn’t
want to sleep under a hay stack, even if there was
one here, in the winter. You would catch cold
and have the sniffle-snuffles.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s so, I might,” Boy Blue said, and he
did not cry so hard now. “But that isn’t all,
Uncle Wiggily,” he went on, nodding at the
rabbit gentleman. “It isn’t all my trouble.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What else is the matter?” asked the bunny
uncle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s my horn,” spoke the little boy who
looked after the cows and sheep. “I can’t make
any music tunes on my horn. And I really have
to blow my horn, you know, for it says in the
Mother Goose book that I must. See, I can’t
blow it a bit.” And Boy Blue put his horn to his
lips, puffed out his cheeks and blew as hard as
he could, but no sound came out.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me try,” said Uncle Wiggily. The rabbit
gentleman took the horn and he, also, tried to
blow. He blew so hard he almost blew off his
tall silk hat, but no sound came from the horn.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, I see what the trouble is!” cried the
bunny uncle with a jolly laugh, looking down
inside the “toot-tooter.” “It is so cold that the
tunes are all frozen solid in your horn. But I
have a hot apple pie here in my basket that I was
taking to Grandpa Goosey Gander. I’ll hold
the cold horn on the hot pie and the tunes will
thaw out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, have you a pie in there?” asked Little
Boy Blue. “Is it the Christmas pie into which
Little Jack Horner put in his thumb and pulled
out a plum?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not quite, but nearly the same,” laughed
Uncle Wiggily. “Now to thaw out the frozen
horn.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The bunny uncle put Little Boy Blue’s horn
in the basket with the hot apple pie. Soon the
ice was melted out of the horn, and Uncle Wiggily
could blow on it, and play tunes, and so
could Boy Blue. Tootity-toot-toot tunes they
both played.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now you are all right!” cried the bunny
uncle. “Come along with me and you may
have a piece of this pie for yourself. And you
may stay with Grandpa Goosey Gander until
summer comes, and then blow your horn for the
sheep in the meadow and the cows in the corn.
There is no need, now, for you to stay out in the
cold and look for a haystack under which to
sleep.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I guess not,” said Boy Blue. “I’ll come
with you, Uncle Wiggily. And thank you, so
much, for helping me. I don’t know what
would have happened only for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pray do not mention it,” politely said Uncle
Wiggily with a laugh. Then he and little Boy
Blue hurried on through the snow, and soon they
were at Grandpa Goosey’s house with the warm
apple pie, and oh! how good it tasted! Oh,
yum-yum!</p>

<p class='c011'>And if the church steeple doesn’t drop the
ding-dong bell down in the pulpit and scare the
organ, I’ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily
and Higgledee Piggledee.</p>

  <h2 id='Ch-VI' class='c013'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND HIGGLEDEE PIGGLEDEE</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>One</span> day Uncle Wiggily Longears, the nice
old gentleman rabbit, was sitting in an easy chair
in the hollow-stump house of the Bushytail
squirrel family, where he was paying a visit to
Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, the two squirrel
boys.</p>

<p class='c011'>There came a knock on the door, but the
bunny uncle did not pay much attention to it,
as he was sort of taking a little sleep after his
dinner of cabbage soup with carrot ice cream
on top.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady
housekeeper, went out in the hall, and when she
came back, with her tail all tied up in a pink ribbon,
(for she was sweeping) she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Uncle Wiggily, a friend of yours has come
to see you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A friend of mine!” cried Uncle Wiggily,
awakening so suddenly that his nose stopped
twinkling. “I hope it isn’t the bad old fox from
the Orange Mountains.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” answered Nurse Jane with a smile,
“it is a lady.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A lady?” exclaimed the old rabbit gentleman,
getting up quickly, and looking in the
glass to see that his ears were not criss-crossed.
“Who can it be?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is Mother Goose,” went on Nurse Jane.
“She says you were so kind as to help Little Boy
Blue the other day, when his horn was frozen,
and you thawed it on the warm pie, that perhaps
you will now help her. She is in trouble.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In trouble, eh?” exclaimed Uncle Wiggily,
sort of smoothing down his vest, fastidious like
and stylish. “I didn’t know she blew a horn.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She doesn’t,” said Nurse Jane. “But I’ll
bring her in and she can tell you, herself, what
she wants.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” cried Mother Goose,
as she set her broom down in one corner, for she
never went out unless she carried it with her.
She said she never could tell when she might
have to sweep the cobwebs out of the sky. “Oh,
Uncle Wiggily, I am in such a lot of trouble!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I will be very glad to help you if I
can,” said the bunny uncle. “What is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s about Higgledee Piggledee,” answered
Mother Goose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Higgledee Piggledee!” exclaimed Uncle
Wiggily, “why that sounds like——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She’s my black hen,” went on Mother Goose.
“You know how the verse goes in the book
about me and my friends.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And, taking off her tall peaked hat, which she
wore when she rode on the back of the old gander,
Mother Goose sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Higgledee Piggledee, my black hen,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>She lays eggs for gentlemen.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Sometimes nine and sometimes ten.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Higgledee Piggledee, my black hen.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Gentlemen come every day,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To see what my black hen doth lay.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“Well,” asked Uncle Wiggily, “what is the
trouble? Has Higgledee Piggledee stopped
laying? If she has I am afraid I can’t help you,
for hens don’t lay many eggs in winter, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, it isn’t that!” said Mother Goose,
quickly. “Higgledee Piggledee lays as many
eggs as ever for gentlemen—sometimes nine and
sometimes ten. But the trouble is the gentlemen
don’t get them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t they come for them?” asked Uncle
Wiggily, sort of puzzled like and wondering.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, they come every day,” said Mother
Goose, “but there are no eggs for them. Some
one else is getting the eggs Higgledee Piggledee
lays.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you s’pose she eats them herself?” asked
the old rabbit gentleman, in a whisper. “Hens
sometimes do, you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not Higgledee Piggledee,” quickly spoke
Mother Goose. “She is too good to do that.
She and I are both worried about the missing
eggs, and as you have been so kind I thought
perhaps you could help us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll try,” Uncle Wiggily said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then come right along to Higgledee Piggledee’s
coop,” invited Mother Goose. “Maybe
you can find out where her eggs go to. She lays
them in her nest, comes off, once in a while, to
get something to eat, but when she goes back to
lay more eggs the first ones are gone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily twinkled his nose, tied his ears
in a hard knot, as he always did when he was
thinking, and then, putting on his fur coat and
taking his rheumatism crutch with him, he went
out with Mother Goose.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily rode in his airship, made of
a clothes-basket, with toy circus balloons on top,
and Mother Goose rode on the back of a big
gander, who was a brother to Grandfather
Goosey Gander. Soon they were at the hen coop
where Higgledee Piggledee lived.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily, I am so glad you
came!” cackled the black hen. “Did Mother
Goose tell you about the egg trouble?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She did, Higgledee Piggledee, and I will
see if I can stop it. Now, you go on the nest and
lay some eggs and then we will see what happens,”
spoke Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Higgledee Piggledee, the black hen, laid
some eggs for gentlemen, and then she went out
in the yard to get some corn to eat, just as she
always did. And, while she was gone, Uncle
Wiggily hid himself in some straw in the hen
coop. Pretty soon the old gentleman heard a
gnawing, rustling sound and up out of a hole in
the ground popped two big rats, with red eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did Higgledee Piggledee lay any eggs to-day?”
asked one rat, in a whisper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” spoke the other, “she did.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then we will take them,” said the first rat.
“Hurray! More eggs for us! No gentlemen
will get these eggs because we’ll take them ourselves.
Hurray!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He got down on his back, with his paws sticking
up in the air. Then the other rat rolled one
of the black hen’s eggs over so the first rat could
hold it in among his four legs. Next, the second
rat took hold of the first rat’s tail and began pulling
him along, egg and all, just as if he were a
sled on a slippery hill, the rat sliding on his back
over the smooth straw. And the eggs rode on
the rat-sled as nicely as you please.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha!” cried Uncle Wiggily, jumping suddenly
out of his hiding-place. “So this is where
Higgledee Piggledee’s eggs have been going,
eh? You rats have been taking them. Scatt!
Shoo! Boo! Skedaddle! Scoot!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And the rats were so scared that they skedaddled
away and shooed themselves and did everything
else Mr. Longears told them to do, and
they took no eggs that day. Then Uncle Wiggily
showed Mother Goose the rat hole, and it
was stopped up with stones so the rats could not
come in the coop again. And ever after that
Higgledee Piggledee, the black hen, could lay
eggs for gentlemen, sometimes nine and sometimes
ten, and there was no more trouble as there
had been before Uncle Wiggily caught the rats
and made them skedaddle.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Mother Goose and the black hen thanked
Uncle Wiggily very much. And if the stylish
lady who lives next door doesn’t take our feather
bed to wear on her hat when she goes to the moving
pictures, I’ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily
and Little Bo Peep.</p>

  <h2 id='Ch-VII' class='c013'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND LITTLE BO PEEP</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>What</span> are you going to do, Nurse Jane?”
asked Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman,
as he saw the muskrat lady housekeeper
going out in the kitchen one morning, with an
apron on, and a dab of white flour on the end of
her nose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am going to make a chocolate cake with
carrot icing on top,” replied Miss Fuzzy
Wuzzy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, good!” cried Uncle Wiggily, and almost
before he knew it he started to clap his
paws, just as Sammie and Susie Littletail, the
rabbit children, might have done, and as they
often did do when they were pleased about anything.
“I just love chocolate cake!” cried the
bunny uncle, who was almost like a boy-bunny
himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you?” asked Nurse Jane. “Then I am
glad I am going to make one,” and, going into
the kitchen of the hollow-stump bungalow, she
began rattling away among the pots, pans and
kettles.</p>

<p class='c011'>For now Nurse Jane and Uncle Wiggily were
living together once more in their own hollow-stump
bungalow. It had burned down, you remember,
but Uncle Wiggily had had it built up
again, and now he did not have to visit around
among his animal friends, though he still called
on them every now and then.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” suddenly cried Nurse Jane from
the kitchen. “Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the matter, Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy?”
asked the bunny uncle. “Did you drop a pan
on your paw?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Uncle Wiggily,” answered the muskrat
lady. “It is worse than that. I can’t make the
chocolate cake after all, I am sorry to say.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! That is too bad! Why not?”
asked the bunny uncle, in a sad and sorrowful
voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because there is no chocolate,” went on
Nurse Jane. “Since we came to our new hollow-stump
bungalow I have not made any cakes,
and to-day I forgot to order the chocolate from
the store for this one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind,” said Uncle Wiggily, kindly.
“I’ll go to the store and get the chocolate for
you. In fact, I would go to two stores and part
of another one for the sake of having a chocolate
cake.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right,” spoke Nurse Jane. “If you get
me the chocolate I’ll make one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Putting on his overcoat, with his tall silk hat
tied down over his ears so they would not blow
away—I mean so his hat would not blow off—and
with his rheumatism crutch under his paw,
off started the old gentleman rabbit, across the
fields and through the woods to the chocolate
store.</p>

<p class='c011'>After buying what he wanted for Nurse Jane’s
cake, the old gentleman rabbit started back for
the hollow-stump bungalow. On the way, he
passed a toy store, and he stopped to look in the
window at the pop-guns, the spinning-tops, the
dolls, the Noah’s Arks, with the animals marching
out of them, and all things like that.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It makes me young again to look at toys,”
said the bunny uncle. Then he went on a little
farther until, all at once, as he was passing a
bush, he heard from behind it the sound of crying.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! Some one in trouble again,” said
Uncle Wiggily. “I wonder if it can be Little
Boy Blue?” He looked, but, instead of seeing
the sheep-boy, whom he had once helped, Uncle
Wiggily saw a little girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! Who are you?” the bunny uncle
asked, “and what is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am Little Bo Peep,” was the answer, “and
I have lost my sheep, and don’t know where to
find them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, let them alone, and they’ll come home,
wagging their tails behind them,” said Uncle
Wiggily quickly, and he laughed jolly like and
happy, because he had made a rhyme to go with
what Bo Peep said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I know that’s the way it is in the Mother
Goose book,” said Little Bo Peep, “but I’ve
waited and waited, and let them alone ever so
long, but they haven’t come home. And now
I’m afraid they’ll freeze.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! That’s so. It <i>is</i> pretty cold for sheep
to be out,” said Uncle Wiggily, as he looked
across the snow-covered field, and toward the
woods where there were icicles hanging down
from the trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look here, Little Bo Peep,” went on the
bunny uncle. “I think your sheep must have
gone home long ago, wagging their tails behind
them. And you, too, had better run home to
Mother Goose. Tell her you met me and that
I sent you home. And, if I find your sheep, I’ll
send them along, too. So don’t worry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, but I don’t like to go home without my
sheep,” said Bo Peep, and tears came into her
eyes. “I ought to bring them with me. But to-day
I went skating on Crystal Lake, up in the
Lemon-Orange Mountains, and I forgot all
about my sheep. Now I am afraid to go home
without them. Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily thought for a minute, then he
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! I have it! I know where I can get
you some sheep to take home with you. Then
Mother Goose will say it is all right. Come
with me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where are you going?” asked Bo Peep.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To get you some sheep.” And Uncle Wiggily
led the little shepherdess girl back to the toy
store, in the window of which he had stopped to
look a while ago.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Give Bo Peep some of your toy woolly
sheep, if you please,” said Uncle Wiggily to the
toy-store man. “She can take them home with
her, while her own sheep are safe in some warm
place, I’m sure. But now she must have some
sort of sheep to take home with her in place of
the lost ones, so it will come out all right, as it is
in the book. And these toy woolly sheep will
do as well as any; won’t they, Little Bo Peep?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, they will; thank you very much,
Uncle Wiggily,” answered Bo Peep, making a
pretty little bow. Then the rabbit gentleman
bought her ten little toy, woolly sheep, each one
with a tail which Bo Peep could wag for them,
and one toy lamb went: “Baa! Baa! Baa!” as
real as anything, having a little phonograph
talking machine inside him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now I can go home to Mother Goose and
make believe these are my lost sheep,” said Bo
Peep, “and it will be all right.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And here is a piece of chocolate for you to
eat,” said Uncle Wiggily. Then Bo Peep hurried
home with her fleecy toy sheep, and, later
on, she found her real ones, all nice and warm, in
the barn where the Cow with the Crumpled
Horn lived. Mother Goose laughed in her jolliest
way when she saw the toy sheep Uncle Wiggily
had bought Bo Peep.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s just like him!” said Mother Goose.</p>

<p class='c011'>And if the goldfish doesn’t climb out of his
tank and hide in the sardine tin, where the stuffed
olives can’t find him, I’ll tell you next about
Uncle Wiggily and Tommie Tucker.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='Ch-VIII' class='c013'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND TOMMIE TUCKER</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Oh</span>, Uncle Wiggily!” called Susie Littletail,
the rabbit girl, one day, as she went over to
see her bunny uncle in his hollow-stump bungalow.
“Oh, Uncle Wiggily! Isn’t it too bad?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Isn’t what too bad?” asked the old gentleman
rabbit, as he scratched his nose with his left
ear, and put his glasses in his pocket, for he was
tired of reading the paper, and felt like going out
for a walk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Too bad about my talking and singing doll,
that I got for Christmas,” said Susie. “She
won’t sing any more. Something inside her is
broken.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Broken? That’s too bad!” said Uncle Wiggily,
kindly. “Let me see. What’s her name?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sallieann Peachbasket Shortcake,” answered
Susie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What a funny name,” laughed the bunny
uncle.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily took Susie’s doll, which had
been given her at Christmas, and looked at it.
Inside the doll was a sort of phonograph, or talking
machine—a very small one, you know—and
when you pushed on a little button in back of
the doll’s dress she would laugh and talk. But,
best of all, when she was in working order, she
would sing a verse, which went something like
this:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I hope you’ll like my little song,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I will not sing it very long.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I have two shoes upon my feet,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And when I’m hungry, then I eat.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Uncle Wiggily wound up the spring in the
doll’s side, and then he pressed the button—like
a shoe button—in her back. But this time Susie’s
doll did not talk, she did not laugh, and, instead
of singing, she only made a scratchy noise like a
phonograph when it doesn’t want to play, or like
Bully No-Tail, the frog boy, when he has a cold
in his head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! This is quite too bad!” said
Uncle Wiggily. “Quite indeed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Isn’t it!” exclaimed Susie. “Do you think
you can fix her, Uncle?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Longears turned the doll upside down
and shook her. Things rattled inside her, but
even then she did not sing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” cried Susie, her little pink nose
going twinkle-inkle, just as did Uncle Wiggily’s.
“What can we do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You leave it to me, Susie,” spoke the old rabbit
gentleman. “I’ll take the doll to the toy shop,
where I bought Little Bo Peep’s sheep, and have
her mended.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, goodie!” cried Susie, clasping her
paws. “Now I know it will be all right,” and
she kissed Uncle Wiggily right between his ears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’m sure I <i>hope</i> it will be all right after
<i>that</i>,” said the bunny uncle, laughing, and feeling
sort of tickled inside.</p>

<p class='c011'>Off hopped Uncle Wiggily to the toy shop,
and there he found the same monkey-doodle gentleman
who had sold him the toy woolly sheep
for Little Bo Peep.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here is more trouble,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“Can you fix Susie’s doll so she will sing, for
the doll is a little girl one, just like Susie, and
her name is Sallieann Peachbasket Shortcake.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The monkey-doodle man in the toy store
looked at the doll.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can fix her,” he said. Going in his backroom
workshop, where there were rocking-horses
that needed new legs, wooden soldiers
who had lost their guns, and steamboats that had
forgotten their whistles, the toy man soon had
Susie’s doll mended again as well as ever. So
that she said: “Papa! Mama! I love you! I
am hungry!” And she laughed: “Ha! Ha!
Ho! Ho!” and she sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I am a little dollie,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>’Bout one year old.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Please take me where it’s warm, for I</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Am feeling rather cold.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>If you’re not in a hurry,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>It won’t take me very long,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To whistle or to sing for you</div>
      <div class='line in1'>My pretty little song.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“Hurray!” cried Uncle Wiggily when he
heard this. “Susie’s dolly is all right again.
Thank you, Mr. Monkey-Doodle, I’ll take her
to Susie.” Then Uncle Wiggily paid the toy-store
keeper and hurried off with Susie’s doll.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily had not gone very far before,
all at once from around the corner of a snow-bank
he heard a sad, little voice crying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My goodness!” said the bunny uncle.
“Some one else is in trouble. I wonder who it
can be this time?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked, and saw a little boy standing in
the snow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hello!” cried Uncle Wiggily, in his jolly
voice. “Who are you, and what’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am Little Tommie Tucker,” was the answer.
“And the matter is I’m hungry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hungry, eh?” asked Uncle Wiggily.
“Well, why don’t you eat?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess you forgot about me and the Mother
Goose book,” spoke the boy. “I’m in that book,
and it says about me:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Little Tommie Tucker,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Must sing for his supper.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>What shall he eat?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Jam and bread and butter.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“Well?” asked Uncle Wiggily. “Why
don’t you sing?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I—I can’t!” answered Tommie. “That’s
the trouble. I have caught such a cold that I
can’t sing. And if I don’t sing Mother Goose
won’t know it is I, and she won’t give me any
supper. Oh, dear! Oh, dear! And I am so
hungry!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There now, there! Don’t cry,” kindly said
the bunny uncle, patting Tommie Tucker on the
head. “I’ll soon have you singing for your supper.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But how can you when I have such a cold?”
asked the little boy. “Listen. I am as hoarse
as a crow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And, truly, he could no more sing than a
rusty gate, or a last year’s door-knob.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, I can soon fix that!” said Uncle Wiggily.
“See, here I have Susie Littletail’s talking
and singing doll, which I have just had mended.
Now you take the doll in your pocket, go to
Mother Goose, and when she asks you to sing
for your supper, just push the button in the doll’s
back. Then the doll will sing and Mother Goose
will think it is you, and give you bread and jam.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, how fine!” cried Tommie Tucker.
“I’ll do it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But afterward,” said Uncle Wiggily, slowly
shaking his paw at Tommie, “afterward you
must tell Mother Goose all about the little joke
you played, or it would not be fair. Tell her the
doll sang and not you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will,” said Tommie. He and Uncle Wiggily
went to Mother Goose’s house, and when
Tommie had to sing for his supper the doll did
it for him. And when Mother Goose heard
about it she said it was a fine trick, and that
Uncle Wiggily was very good to think of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the bunny uncle took Susie’s mended
doll to her, and the next day Tommie’s cold was
all better and he could sing for his supper himself,
just as the book tells about.</p>

<p class='c011'>And if the little mouse doesn’t go to sleep in
the cat’s cradle and scare the milk bottle so it
rolls off the back stoop, I’ll tell you next about
Uncle Wiggily and Pussy Cat Mole.</p>

  <h2 id='Ch-IX' class='c013'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND PUSSY CAT MOLE</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Oh</span>, dear! I don’t believe he’s ever coming!”
said Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat
lady housekeeper, as she stood at the window
of the hollow-stump bungalow one day, and
looked down through the woods.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For whom are you looking, Nurse Jane?”
asked Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman.
“If it’s for the letter-man, I think he
went past some time ago.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I wasn’t looking for the letter-man,”
said the muskrat lady. “I am expecting a messenger-boy
cat to bring home my new dress from
the dressmaker’s, but I don’t see him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A new dress, eh?” asked Uncle Wiggily.
“Pray, what is going on?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dress is going on me, as soon as it comes
home, Uncle Wiggily,” the muskrat lady answered,
laughingly. “And then I am going
on over to the house of Mrs. Wibblewobble, the
duck lady. She and I are going to have a little
tea party together, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mind? Certainly not! I’m glad to have
you go out and enjoy yourself,” said Uncle Wiggily,
jolly like and also laughing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I can’t go if my new dress doesn’t come,”
went on Nurse Jane. “That is, I don’t want to.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look here!” said the bunny uncle, “I’ll
tell you what I’ll do, Nurse Jane, I’ll go for your
dress myself and bring it home. I have nothing
to do. I’ll go get your dress at the dressmaker’s.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you, really?” cried the muskrat lady.
“That will be fine! Then I can curl my whiskers
and tie a new pink bow for my tail. You
are very good, Uncle Wiggily.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, not at all! Not at all!” the rabbit gentleman
said, modest like and shy. Then he
hopped out of the hollow-stump bungalow and
across the fields and through the woods to where
Nurse Jane’s dressmaker made dresses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, Nurse Jane’s dress!” exclaimed
Mrs. Spin-Spider, who wove silk for all the
dresses worn by the lady animals of Woodland.
“Yes, I have just finished it. I was about to call
a messenger-boy cat and send it home, but now
you are here you may take it. And here is some
cloth I had left over. Nurse Jane might want it
if ever she tears a hole in her dress.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily put the extra pieces of cloth
in his pocket, and then Mrs. Spin-Spider
wrapped Nurse Jane’s dress up nicely for him
in tissue paper, as fine as the web which she had
spun for the silk, and the rabbit gentleman
started back to the hollow-stump bungalow.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Spin-Spider lived on Second Mountain,
and, as Uncle Wiggily’s bungalow was on First
Mountain, he had quite a way to go to get home.
And when he was about half way there he passed
a little house near a gray rock that looked like
an eagle, and in the house he heard a voice saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! Oh, isn’t it too bad? Now I
can’t go!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! I wonder who that can be?” thought
the rabbit gentleman. “It sounds like some one
in trouble. I will ask if I can do anything to
help.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The rabbit gentleman knocked on the door
of the little house, and a voice said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come in!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily entered, and there in the
middle of the room he saw a pussy cat lady holding
up a dress with a big hole burned in it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I beg your pardon, but who are you and
what is the matter?” politely asked the bunny
uncle, making a low bow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My name is Pussy Cat Mole,” was the answer,
“and you can see the trouble for yourself.
I am Pussy Cat Mole; I jumped over a coal,
and——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In your best petticoat burned a great hole,”
finished Uncle Wiggily. “I know you, now.
You are from Mother Goose’s book and I met
you at a party in Belleville, where they have a
bluebell flower on the school to call the animal
children to their lessons.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s it!” meowed Pussy Cat Mole. “I
am glad you remember me, Uncle Wiggily. It
was at a party I met you, and now I am going
to another. Or, rather, I was going until I
jumped over a coal, and in my best petticoat
burned a great hole. Now I can’t go,” and she
held up the burned dress, sorrowful like and sad.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How did you happen to jump over the
coal?” asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, it fell out of my stove,” said Pussy Cat
Mole, “and I jumped over it in a hurry to get
the fire shovel to take it up. That’s how I burned
my dress. And now I can’t go to the party, for
it was my best petticoat, and Mrs. Wibblewobble,
the duck lady, asked me to be there early,
too; and now—Oh, dear!” and Pussy Cat Mole
felt very badly, indeed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Wibblewobble’s!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“Why, Nurse Jane is going there to a
little tea party, too! This is her new dress I am
taking home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Has she burned a hole in it?” asked the
pussy cat lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, she has not, I am glad to say,” the bunny
uncle replied. “She hasn’t had it on, yet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then she can go to the party, but I can’t,”
said Pussy Cat Mole, sorrowfully. “Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, you can go!” suddenly cried Uncle
Wiggily. “See here! I have some extra pieces
of cloth, left over when Mrs. Spin-Spider made
Nurse Jane’s dress. Now you can take these
pieces of cloth and mend the hole burned by
the coal in your best petticoat. Then you can
go to the party.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, so I can,” meowed the pussy cat. So,
with a needle and thread, and the cloth she
mended her best petticoat.</p>

<p class='c011'>All around the edges and over the top of the
burned hole the pussy cat lady sewed the left-over
pieces of Nurse Jane’s dress which was almost
the same color. Then, when the mended
place was pressed with a warm flat-iron, Uncle
Wiggily cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You would never know there had been a
burned hole!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s fine!” meowed Pussy Cat Mole.
“Thank you so much, Uncle Wiggily, for helping
me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pray do not mention it,” said the rabbit gentleman,
bashful like and casual. Then he hurried
to the hollow-stump bungalow with Nurse
Jane’s dress, and the muskrat lady said he had
done just right to help mend Pussy Cat Mole’s
dress with the left-over pieces. So she and
Nurse Jane both went to Mrs. Wibblewobble’s
little tea party, and had a good time.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so, you see, it came out just as it did in
the book: Pussy Cat Mole jumped over a coal,
and in her best petticoat burned a great hole.
But the hole it was mended, and my story is
ended. Only never before was it known how the
hole was mended. Uncle Wiggily did it.</p>

<p class='c011'>And, if the apple doesn’t jump out of the
peach dumpling and hide in the lemon pie when
the knife and fork try to play tag with it, I’ll tell
you next about Uncle Wiggily and Jack and
Jill, and it will be a Valentine story.</p>

  <h2 id='Ch-X' class='c013'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND JACK AND JILL</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily Longears</span>, the nice old gentleman
rabbit, was asleep in an easy chair in
his hollow-stump bungalow one morning when
he heard some one calling:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hi, Jack! Ho, Jill! Where are you? Come
at once, if you please!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! What’s that? Some one calling me?”
asked the bunny uncle, sitting up so suddenly
that he knocked over his red, white and blue
striped barber-pole rheumatism crutch that
Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady
housekeeper, had gnawed for him out of a corn-stalk.
“Is any one calling me?” asked Mr.
Longears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” answered Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy.
“That’s Mother Goose calling Jack and Jill to
get a pail of water.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! is that all?” asked the rabbit gentleman,
rubbing his pink eyes and making his nose
twinkle like the sharp end of an ice cream cone.
“Just Mother Goose calling Jack and Jill; eh?
Well, I’ll go out and see if I can find them for
her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily was always that way, you
know, wanting to help some one. This time it
was Mother Goose. His new hollow-stump
bungalow was built right near where Mother
Goose lived, with all her big family; Peter-Peter
Pumpkin-Eater, Little Jack Horner, Bo Peep
and many others.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ho, Jack! Hi, Jill! Where are you?”
called Mother Goose, as Uncle Wiggily came
out of his hollow stump.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can’t you find those two children?” asked
the rabbit gentleman, making a polite good
morning bow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am sorry to say I cannot,” answered
Mother Goose. “They were over to see the Old
Woman Who Lives in a Shoe, a while ago, but
where they are now I can’t guess, and I need a
pail of water for Simple Simon to go fishing in,
for to catch a whale.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’ll get the water for you,” said Uncle
Wiggily, taking the pail. “Perhaps Jack and
Jill are off playing somewhere, and they have
forgotten all about getting the water.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I suppose they’ll forget about tumbling
down hill, too,” went on Mother Goose, sort of
nervous like. “But they must not. If they don’t
fall down, so Jack can break his crown, it won’t
be like the story in my book, and everything will
be upside down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So Jack has to break his crown; eh?” asked
Uncle Wiggily. “That’s too bad. I hope he
won’t hurt himself too much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, he’s used to it by this time,” Mother
Goose said. “He doesn’t mind falling, nor does
Jill mind tumbling down after.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well, then, I’ll get the pail of water
for you,” spoke the bunny uncle, “and Jack and
Jill can do the tumbling-down-hill part.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily took the water pail and started
for the hill, on top of which was the well owned
by Mother Goose. As the bunny uncle was
walking along he suddenly heard a voice calling
to him from behind a bush.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily, will you do me a
favor?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I certainly will,” said Mr. Longears, “but
who are you, and where are you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here I am, over here,” the voice went on.
“I’m Jack, and will you please give this to Jill
when you see her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Out from behind the bush stepped Jack, the
little Mother Goose boy. In his hand he held a
piece of white birch bark, prettily colored red,
green and pink, and on it was a little verse which
read:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Can you tell me, pretty maid,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Tell me and not be afraid,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Who’s the sweetest girl, and true?—</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I can; for she’s surely you!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“What’s this? What’s this?” asked Uncle
Wiggily, in surprise. “What’s this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s a valentine for Jill,” said Jack. “To-day
is Valentine’s Day, you see, but I don’t want
Jill to know I sent it, so I went off here and hid
until I could see you to ask you to take it to her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, I’ll do it,” Uncle Wiggily said,
laughing. “I’ll take your valentine to Jill for
you. So that’s why you weren’t ’round to get
the pail of water; is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” answered Jack. “I wanted to finish
making my valentine. As soon as you give it
to Jill I’ll get the water.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, never mind that,” said the bunny uncle.
“I’ll get the water, just you do the falling-down-hill
part. I’m too old for that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will,” promised Jack. Then Uncle Wiggily
went on up the hill, and pretty soon he
heard some one else calling him, and, all of a
sudden, out from behind a stump stepped Jill,
the little Mother Goose girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” said Jill, bashfully
holding out a pretty red leaf, shaped like a heart,
“will you please give this to Jack. I don’t want
him to know I sent it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course, I’ll give it to him,” promised the
rabbit gentleman. “It’s a valentine, I suppose,
and here is something for you,” and while Jill
was reading the valentine Jack had sent her,
Uncle Wiggily looked at the red heart-shaped
leaf. On it Jill had written in blue ink:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“One day when I went to school,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Teacher taught to me this rule:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Eight and one add up to nine;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>So I’ll be your valentine.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“My, that’s nice!” said Uncle Wiggily,
laughing. “So that’s why you’re hiding off here
for, Jill, to make a valentine for Jack?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s it,” Jill answered, blushing sort of
pink, like the frosting on a strawberry cake.
“But I don’t want Jack to know it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll never tell him,” said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>So he went on up the hill to get a pail of water
for Mother Goose. And on his way back he
gave Jill’s valentine to Jack, who liked it very
much.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now, since you got the water, Jill
and I will go tumble down hill,” said Jack, as
he found the little girl, where she was reading
his valentine again. Up the hill they went, near
the well of water, and Jack fell down, and broke
his crown, while Jill came tumbling after, while
Uncle Wiggily looked on and laughed. So it
all happened just as it did in the book, you see.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mother Goose was very glad Uncle Wiggily
had brought the water for Simple Simon to go
fishing in, and that afternoon she gave a valentine
party for Sammie and Susie Littletail, the
Bushytail squirrel brothers, Nannie and Billie
Wagtail, the goats, and all the other animal
friends of Uncle Wiggily. And every one had
a fine time.</p>

<p class='c011'>And if the cup doesn’t jump out of the saucer
and hide in the spoonholder, where the coffee
cake can’t find it, I’ll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and little Jack Horner.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='Ch-XI' class='c013'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND JACK HORNER</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Well</span>, I think I’ll go for a walk,” said Uncle
Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman, one
afternoon, when he was sitting out on the front
porch of his hollow-stump bungalow. He had
just eaten a nice dinner that Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper, had gotten
ready for him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go for a walk!” exclaimed Nurse Jane.
“Why, Mr. Longears, excuse me for saying so,
but you went walking this morning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know I did,” answered the bunny uncle,
“but no adventure happened to me then. I
don’t really count it a good day unless I have had
an adventure. So I’ll go walking again, and
perhaps I may find one. If I do, I’ll come home
and tell you all about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right,” said Nurse Jane. “You are a
funny rabbit, to be sure! Going off in the woods,
looking for adventures when you might sit
quietly here on the bungalow front porch.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s just it!” laughed Uncle Wiggily.
“I don’t like to be too quiet. Off I go!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope you have a nice adventure!” Nurse
Jane called after him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” answered Uncle Wiggily, politely.</p>

<p class='c011'>Away over the fields and through the woods
went the bunny uncle, looking on all sides for
an adventure, when, all of a sudden he heard behind
him a sound that went:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Honk! Honk! Honkity-honk-honk!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! That must be a wild goose!” thought
the rabbit gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>So he looked up in the air, over his head, where
the wild geese always fly, but, instead of seeing
any of the big birds, Uncle Wiggily felt something
whizz past him, and again he heard the
loud “Honk-honk!” noise, and then he sneezed,
for a lot of dust from the road flew up his nose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My!” he heard some one cry. “We nearly
ran over a rabbit! Did you see?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And a big automobile, with real people in it,
shot past. It was the horn of the auto that Uncle
Wiggily had heard, and not a wild goose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! That came pretty close to me,” thought
Uncle Wiggily, as the auto went on down the
road. “I never ride my automobile as fast as
that, even when I sprinkle pepper on the bologna
sausage tires. I don’t like to scare any
one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps the people in the auto did not mean
to so nearly run over Uncle Wiggily. Let us
hope so.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old gentleman rabbit hopped on down
the road, that was between the woods and the
fields, and, pretty soon, he saw something bright
and shining in the dust, near where the auto had
passed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, maybe that’s a diamond,” he said, as he
stooped over to pick it up. But it was only a
shiny button-hook, and not a diamond at all.
Some one in the automobile had dropped it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’ll put it in my pocket,” said Uncle
Wiggily to himself. “It may come in useful to
button Nurse Jane’s shoes, or mine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The bunny gentleman went on a little farther,
and, pretty soon, he came to a tiny house, with
a red chimney sticking up out of the roof.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! I wonder who lives there?” said
Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>He stood still for a moment, looking through
his glasses at the house and then, all of a sudden,
he saw a little lady, with a tall, peaked hat
on, run out and look up and down the road. Her
hat was just like an ice cream cone turned upside
down. Only don’t turn your ice cream cone
upside down if it has any cream in it, for you
might spill your treat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Help! Help! Help!” cried the lady, who
had come out of the house with the red chimney.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! That sounds like trouble!” said Uncle
Wiggily. “I think I had better hurry over there
and see what it is all about.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He hopped over toward the little house, and,
when he reached it he saw that the little lady
who was calling for help was Mother Goose herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” exclaimed Mother
Goose. “I am so glad to see you! Will you
please go for help for me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, certainly I will,” answered the bunny
gentleman. “But what kind of help do you
want; help for the kitchen, or a wash-lady help
or——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Neither of those,” said Mother Goose. “I
want help so Little Jack Horner can get his
thumb out of the pie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Get his thumb out of the pie!” cried Uncle
Wiggily. “What in the world do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, you see it’s this way,” went on Mother
Goose. “Jack Horner lives here. You must
have heard about him. He is in my book. His
verse goes like this:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Little Jack Horner</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Sat in a corner,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Eating a Christmas pie.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>He put in his thumb,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And pulled out a plum,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And said what a great boy am I.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“That’s the boy I mean,” cried Mother Goose.
“But the trouble is that Jack can’t get his thumb
out. He put it in the pie, to pull out the plum,
but it won’t come out—neither the plum nor the
thumb. They are stuck fast for some reason or
other. I wish you’d go for Dr. Possum, so he
can help us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will,” said Uncle Wiggily. “But is Jack
Horner sitting in a corner, as it says in the
book?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, he’s doing that all right,” answered
Mother Goose. “But, corner or no corner, he
can’t pull out his thumb.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll get the doctor at once,” promised the
bunny uncle. He hurried over to Dr. Possum’s
house, but could not find him, as Dr. Possum
was, just then, called to see Jillie Longtail, who
had the mouse-trap fever.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dr. Possum not in!” cried Mother Goose,
when Uncle Wiggily had hopped back and told
her. “That’s too bad! Oh, we must do something
for Jack. He’s crying and going on terribly
because he can’t get his thumb out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily thought for a minute. Then,
putting his paw in his pocket, he felt the button-hook
which had dropped from the automobile
that nearly ran over him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! I know what to do!” cried the bunny
uncle, suddenly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What?” asked Mother Goose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll pull out Jack’s thumb myself, with this
button-hook,” said Mr. Longears. “I’ll make
him all right without waiting for Dr. Possum.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Into the room, where, in the corner, Jack was
sitting, went the bunny gentleman. There he
saw the Christmas-pie boy, with his thumb away
down deep under the top crust.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” cried Jack. “I’m in
such trouble. Oh, dear! I can’t get my thumb
out. It must be caught on the edge of the pan,
or something!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t cry,” said Uncle Wiggily, kindly.
“I’ll get it out for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he put the button-hook through the hole
in the top pie crust, close to Jack’s thumb. Then,
getting the hook on the plum, Uncle Wiggily,
with his strong paws, pulled and pulled and
pulled, and——</p>

<p class='c011'>All of a sudden out came the plum and Jack
Horner’s thumb, and they weren’t stuck fast any
more.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, thank you, so much!” said Jack, as he
got up out of his corner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pray don’t mention it,” spoke Uncle Wiggily,
politely. “I am glad I could help you, and
it also makes an adventure for me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Jack Horner, went back to his corner
and ate the plum that stuck to his thumb. And
Uncle Wiggily, putting the button-hook back
in his pocket, went on to his hollow-stump bungalow.
He had had his adventure.</p>

<p class='c011'>So everything came out all right, you see, and
if the snow-shovel doesn’t go off by itself, sliding
down hill with the ash can, when it ought
to be boiling the cups and saucers for supper,
I’ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and Mr.
Pop-Goes.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='Ch-XII' class='c013'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND MR. POP-GOES</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily</span>,” said Mrs. Littletail, the
rabbit lady, one morning, as she came in the
dining-room where Mr. Longears was reading
the cabbage leaf paper after breakfast, “Uncle
Wiggily, I don’t like you to go out in such a
storm as this, but I do need some things from the
store, and I have no one to send.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, I’ll be only too glad to go,” cried the
bunny uncle, who was spending a few days visiting
the Littletail family in their underground
burrow-house. “It isn’t snowing very hard,”
and he looked out through the window, which
was up a little way above ground to make the
burrow light. “What do you want, Mrs. Littletail?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I want a loaf of bread and some sugar,”
said the bunny mother of Sammie and Susie Littletail.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you shall certainly have what you
want!” cried Uncle Wiggily, as he got ready
to go to the store. Soon he was on his way, wearing
his fur coat, and hopping along on his corn-stalk
rheumatism crutch, while his pink nose
was twinkling in the frosty air like a red lantern
on the back of an automobile.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A loaf of home-made bread and three and a
half pounds of granulated sugar,” said Uncle
Wiggily to the monkey-doodle gentleman who
kept the grocery store. “And the best that you
have, if you please, as it’s for Mrs. Littletail.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You shall certainly have the best!” cried the
monkey-doodle gentleman, with a jolly laugh.
And while he was wrapping up the things for
Uncle Wiggily to carry home, all at once there
sounded in the store a loud:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pop!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My! What’s that?” asked Uncle Wiggily,
surprised like and excited. “I heard a bang like
a gun. Are there any hunter-men, with their
dogs about? If there are I must be careful.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, that wasn’t a gun,” said the monkey-doodle
gentleman. “That was only one of the
toy balloons in my window. I had some left
over from last year, so I blew them up and put
them in my window to make it look pretty. Now
and then one of them bursts.” And just then,
surely enough, “Pop! Bang!” went another
toy balloon, bursting and shriveling all up.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily looked in the front window of
the store and saw some blown-up balloons that
had not burst.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll take two of those,” he said to the monkey-doodle
gentleman. “Sammie and Susie Littletail
will like to play with them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Better take two or three,” said the monkey-doodle
gentleman. “I’ll let you have them
cheap, as they are old balloons, and they will
burst easily.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he let the air out of four balloons and gave
them to Uncle Wiggily to take home to the
bunny children.</p>

<p class='c011'>The rabbit gentleman started off through the
snow-storm toward the underground house, but
he had not gone very far before, just as he was
coming out from behind a big stump, he heard
voices talking.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, I’ll tell you how we can get those rabbits,”
Uncle Wiggily heard one voice say. “I’ll
crawl down in the burrow, and as soon as they
see me they’ll be scared and run out—Uncle
Wiggily, Mrs. Littletail, the two children, Nurse
Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy and all. Then you can grab
them, Mr. Bigtail! I am glad I happened to
meet you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, ha!” thought Uncle Wiggily. “Mr.
Bigtail! I ought to know that name. It’s the
fox, and he and some one else seem to be after
us rabbits. But I thought the fox promised to be
good and let me alone. He must have changed
his mind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily peeked cautiously around the
stump, taking care to make no noise, and there
he saw a fox and another animal talking. And
the rabbit gentleman saw that it was not the fox
who had promised to be good, but another one,
of the same name, who was bad.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I’ll go down the hole and drive out the
rabbits and you can grab them,” said the queer
animal.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s good,” growled the fox, “but to
whom have I the honor of speaking?” That
was his way of asking the name of the other animal,
you see.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’m called Mr. Pop-Goes,” said the
other.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Pop-Goes! What a queer name,” said
the fox, and all the while Uncle Wiggily was
listening with his big ears, and wondering what
it all meant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Pop-Goes isn’t all my name,” said the
queer animal. “Don’t you know the story in
the book? The monkey chased the cobbler’s
wife all around the steeple. That’s the way the
money goes, Pop! goes the weasel. I’m Mr.
Pop-Goes, the weasel, you see. I’m ’specially
good at chasing rabbits.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I see!” barked Mr. Bigtail, the fox.
“Well, I’ll be glad if you can help me get those
rabbits. I’ve been over to that Uncle Wiggily’s
hollow-stump bungalow, but he isn’t around.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, he’s visiting the Littletail rabbits,” said
Mr. Pop-Goes, the weasel. “But we’ll drive
him out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Uncle Wiggily felt very badly, indeed,
for he knew that a weasel is the worst animal a
rabbit can have after him. Weasels are very
fond of rabbits. They love them so much they
want to eat them, and Uncle Wiggily did not
want to be eaten, even by Mr. Pop-Goes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” he thought. “What can I do
to scare away the bad fox and Mr. Pop-Goes, the
weasel? Oh, dear!” Then he thought of the
toy balloons, that made a noise like a gun when
they were blown up and burst. “The very
thing!” thought the rabbit gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>Carefully, as he hid behind the stump, Uncle
Wiggily took out one of the toy balloons. Carefully
he blew it up, bigger and bigger and
bigger, until, all at once:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bang!” exploded the toy balloon, even making
Uncle Wiggily jump. And as for the fox
and Mr. Pop-Goes, the weasel, why they were
so kerslostrated (if you will kindly excuse me for
using such a word) that they turned a somersault,
jumped up in the air, came down, turned
a peppersault, and started to run.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you hear that noise?” asked the weasel.
“That was a pop, and whenever I hear a pop I
have to go! And I’m going fast!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So am I!” barked the fox. “That was a
hunter with a gun after us, I guess. We’ll get
those rabbits some other time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maybe you will, and maybe not!” laughed
Uncle Wiggily, as he hurried on to the burrow
with the bread, sugar and the rest of the toy balloons,
with which Sammie and Susie had lots
of fun.</p>

<p class='c011'>So you see Mr. Pop-Goes, the weasel, didn’t
get Uncle Wiggily after all, and if the pepper
caster doesn’t throw dust in the potato’s eyes,
and make it sneeze at the rag doll, I’ll tell you
next about Uncle Wiggily and Simple Simon.</p>

  <h2 id='Ch-XIII' class='c013'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND SIMPLE SIMON</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>There</span>!” exclaimed Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper, who,
with Uncle Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman,
was visiting at the Littletail rabbit burrow
one day. “There they are, Uncle Wiggily,
all nicely wrapped up for you to carry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s nicely wrapped up?” asked the
bunny uncle. “And what do you want me to
carry?” And he looked over the tops of his
spectacles at the muskrat lady, sort of surprised
and wondering.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want you to carry the jam tarts, and they
are all nicely wrapped up,” went on Nurse Jane.
“Don’t you remember, I said I was going to
make some for you to take over to Mrs. Wibblewobble,
the duck lady?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, of course!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“The jam tarts are for Lulu, Alice and Jimmie
Wibblewobble, the duck children. I remember
now. I’ll take them right over.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are all nicely wrapped up in a clean
napkin,” went on the muskrat lady, “so be careful
not to squash them and squeeze out the jam,
as they are very fresh.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll be careful,” promised the old rabbit gentleman,
as he put on his fur coat and took down
off the parlor mantle his red, white and blue
striped barber-pole rheumatism crutch, made of
a corn-stalk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, wait a minute, Uncle Wiggily! Wait
a minute!” cried Mrs. Littletail, the bunny
mother of Sammie and Susie, the rabbit children,
as Mr. Longears started out. “Where are
you going?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Over to Mrs. Wibblewobble, the duck lady’s
house, with some jam tarts for Lulu, Alice and
Jimmie,” answered Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then would you mind carrying, also, this
little rubber plant over to her?” asked Mrs. Littletail.
“I told Mrs. Wibblewobble I would
send one to her the first chance I had.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Right gladly will I take it,” said Uncle Wiggily.
So Mrs. Littletail, the rabbit lady, wrapped
the pot of the little rubber plant, with its thick,
shiny green leaves, in a piece of paper, and Uncle
Wiggily, tucking it under one paw, while with
the other he leaned on his crutch, started off
over the fields and through the woods, with the
jam tarts in his pocket. Over toward the home
of the Wibblewobble duck family he hopped.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Longears, the nice old rabbit gentleman,
had not gone very far before, all at once, from
behind a snow-covered stump, he heard a voice
saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! I know I’ll never find him! I’ve
looked all over and I can’t see him anywhere.
Oh, dear! Oh, dear! What shall I do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My! That sounds like some one in trouble,”
Uncle Wiggily said to himself. “I wonder if
that is any of my little animal friends? I must
look.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the rabbit gentleman peeked over the top
of the stump, and there he saw a queer-looking
boy, with a funny smile on his face, which was
as round and shiny as the bottom of a new dish
pan. And the boy looked so kind that Uncle
Wiggily knew he would not hurt even a lollypop,
much less a rabbit gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, hello!” cried the boy, as soon as he saw
Uncle Wiggily. “Who are you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am Mr. Longears,” replied the bunny
uncle. “And who are you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, I’m Simple Simon,” was the answer.
“I’m in the Mother Goose book, you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, I remember,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“But you seem to be <i>out</i> of the book, just now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am,” said Simple Simon. “The page with
my picture on it fell out of the book, and so I ran
away. But I can’t find him anywhere and I
don’t know what to do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who is it you can’t find?” asked the rabbit.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The pie-man,” answered the funny, round-faced
boy. “Don’t you remember, it says in
the book, ‘Simple Simon met a pie-man going
to the fair?’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, I remember,” Uncle Wiggily answered.
“What’s next?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I can’t find him anywhere,” said
Simple Simon. “I guess the pie-man didn’t fall
out of the book when I did.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s too bad,” spoke Uncle Wiggily,
kindly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is,” said Simple Simon. “For you know
he ought to ask me for my penny, when I want
to taste of his pies, and indeed, I haven’t any
penny—not any, and I’m so hungry for a piece
of pie!” And Simple Simon began to cry.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, don’t cry,” said Uncle Wiggily. “See,
in my pocket I have some jam tarts. They are
for Lulu, Alice and Jimmie Wibblewobble, the
ducks, but there are enough to let you have one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, you are a regular pie-man yourself;
aren’t you?” laughed Simple Simon, as he ate
one of Nurse Jane’s nice jam tarts.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, you might call me that,” said the
bunny uncle. “Though I s’pose a tart-man
would be nearer right.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But there’s something else,” went on Simple
Simon. “You know in the Mother Goose book
I have to go for water, in my mother’s sieve. But
soon it all ran through.” And then, cried
Simple Simon, “Oh, dear, what shall I do?”
And he held out a sieve, just like a coffee
strainer, full of little holes. “How can I ever
get water in that?” he asked. “I’ve tried and
tried, but I can’t. No one can! It all runs
through!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily thought for a minute. Then
he cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have it! I’ll pull some leaves off the rubber
plant I am taking to Mrs. Wibblewobble.
We’ll put the leaves in the bottom of the sieve,
and, being of rubber, water can’t get through
them. Then the sieve will hold water, or milk
either, and you can bring it to your mother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, fine!” cried Simple Simon, licking the
sticky squeegee jam off his fingers. So Uncle
Wiggily put some rubber plant leaves in the
bottom of the sieve, and Simple Simon, filling it
full of water, carried it home to his mother, and
not a drop ran through, which, of course, wasn’t
at all like the story in the book.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But that isn’t my fault,” said Uncle Wiggily,
as he took the rest of the jam tarts to the
Wibblewobble children. “I just had to help
Simple Simon.” Which was very kind of Uncle
Wiggily, I think; don’t you? It didn’t matter if,
just once, something happened that wasn’t in the
book.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Mrs. Wibblewobble didn’t at all mind
some of the leaves being off her rubber plant.
So you see we should always be kind when we
can; and if the canary bird doesn’t go to sleep
in the bowl with the goldfish, and forget to
whistle like an alarm clock in the morning, I’ll
tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the
crumple-horn cow.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='Ch-XIV' class='c013'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE CRUMPLE-HORN COW</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Where</span> are you going, Uncle Wiggily?”
asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat
lady housekeeper, as she saw the rabbit gentleman
starting out from his hollow-stump bungalow
one day. He was back again from his visit
to Sammie and Susie Littletail.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’m just going for a walk,” answered
Mr. Longears. “I have not had an exciting adventure
since I carried the valentines for Jack
and Jill, before they tumbled down hill, and
perhaps to-day I may find something else to
make me lively, and happy and skippy like.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Too much hopping and skipping is not
good for you,” the muskrat lady said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I think it is, if you will excuse me for
saying so,” spoke Uncle Wiggily politely. “It
keeps my rheumatism from getting too painful.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, taking his red, white and blue-striped
rheumatism crutch from inside the talking machine
horn, Uncle Wiggily started off.</p>

<p class='c011'>Over the fields and through the woods went
the rabbit gentleman, until, pretty soon, as he
was walking along, wondering what would happen
to him that day, he heard a voice saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Moo! Moo! Moo-o-o-o-o!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! That sounds rather sad and unhappy
like,” spoke the rabbit gentleman to himself.
“I wonder if it can be any one in trouble?”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he peeked through the bushes and there he
saw a nice cow, who was standing with one foot
in the hollow of a big stump.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Moo! Moo!” cried the cow. “Oh, dear,
will no one help me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, of course, I’ll help you,” kindly said
Uncle Wiggily. “What is the matter, and who
are you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, I am the Mother Goose cow with the
crumpled horn,” was the answer, “and my foot
is caught so tightly in the hole of this stump that
I cannot get it out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, I’ll help you, Mrs. Crumpled-horn
Cow,” said Uncle Wiggily, kindly. Then, with
his rheumatism crutch, the rabbit gentleman
pushed loose the cow’s hoof from where it was
caught in the stump, and she was all right again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, thank you so much, Uncle Wiggily,”
spoke the crumpled-horn cow. “If ever I can
do you a favor I will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” said the rabbit gentleman, politely.
“I’m sure you will. But how did you
happen to get your hoof caught in that stump?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I was standing on it, trying to see if I
could jump over the moon,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jump over the moon!” cried the rabbit gentleman.
“You surprise me! Why in the
world——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s this way, you see,” spoke the crumpled-horn
lady cow. “In the Mother Goose book it
says: ‘Hi-diddle-diddle, the cat’s in the fiddle,
the cow jumped over the moon.’ Well, if one
cow did that, I don’t see why another one can’t.
I got up on the stump, to try and jump over the
moon, but my foot slipped and I was caught fast.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I suppose I should not have tried it, for I
am the cow with the crumpled horn. You have
heard of me, I dare say. I’m the cow with the
crumpled horn, that little Boy Blue drove out
of the corn. I tossed the dog that worried that
cat that caught the rat that ate the malt that lay
in the house that Jack built.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I remember you now,” said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And this is my crumpled horn,” went on the
cow, and she showed the rabbit gentleman how
one of her horns was all crumpled and crooked
and twisted, just like a corkscrew that is used
to pull hard corks out of bottles.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, thank you again for pulling out my
foot,” said the cow, as she turned away. “Now
I must go toss that dog once more, for he’s always
worrying the cat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the cow went away, and Uncle Wiggily
hopped on through the woods and over the
fields. He had had an adventure, you see, helping
the cow, and later on he had another one,
for he met Jimmie Wibblewobble, the boy duck,
who had lost his penny going to the store for a
corn-meal-flavored lollypop. Uncle Wiggily
found the penny in the snow, and Jimmie was
happy once more.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next day when Uncle Wiggily awakened
in his hollow-stump bungalow, and tried to get
out of bed, he was so lame and stiff that he could
hardly move.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” cried the rabbit gentleman.
“Ouch! Oh, what a pain!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it?” asked Nurse Jane. “What’s
the matter?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My rheumatism,” answered Uncle Wiggily.
“Please send to Dr. Possum and get some
medicine. Ouch! Oh, my!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll go for the medicine myself,” Nurse Jane
said, and, tying her tail up in a double bow-knot,
so she would not step on it, and trip, as she hurried
along, over to Dr. Possum’s she went.</p>

<p class='c011'>The doctor was just starting out to go to see
Nannie Wagtail, the little goat girl, who had
the hornache, but before going there Dr. Possum
ran back into his office, got a big bottle of
medicine, which he gave to Nurse Jane, saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“When you get back to the hollow-stump
bungalow pull out the cork and rub some on
Uncle Wiggily’s pain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rub the cork on?” asked Nurse Jane, sort
of surprised like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, rub on some of the medicine from the
bottle,” answered Dr. Possum, laughing as he
hurried off.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily had a bad pain when Nurse
Jane got back.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll soon fix you,” said the muskrat lady.
“Wait until I get the cork out of this bottle.”
But that was more easily said than done. Nurse
Jane tried with all her might to pull out the cork
with her paws and even with her teeth. Then
she used a hair pin, but it only bent and twisted
itself all up in a knot.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, hurry with the medicine!” begged
Uncle Wiggily. “Hurry, please!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can’t get the cork out,” said Nurse Jane.
“The cork is stuck in the bottle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me try,” spoke the bunny uncle. But
he could not get the cork out, either, and his pain
was getting worse all the while.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then came a knock on the bungalow
door, and a voice said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am the cow with the crumpled horn. I
just met Dr. Possum, and he told me Uncle Wiggily
had the rheumatism. Is there anything I
can do for him? I’d like to do him a favor as
he did me one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, you can help me,” said the rabbit gentleman.
“Can you pull a tight cork out of a
bottle?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed I can!” mooed the cow. “Just
watch me!” She put her crooked, crumpled
horn, which was just like a corkscrew, in the
cork, and, with one twist, out it came from the
bottle as easily as anything. Then Nurse Jane
could rub some medicine on Uncle Wiggily’s
rheumatism, which soon felt much better.</p>

<p class='c011'>So you see Mother Goose’s crumpled-horn
cow can do other things besides tossing cat-worrying
dogs. And if the fried egg doesn’t go
to sleep in the dish pan, so the knives and forks
can’t play tag there, I’ll tell you next of Uncle
Wiggily and Old Mother Hubbard.</p>

  <h2 id='Ch-XV' class='c013'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND OLD MOTHER HUBBARD</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily</span>, have you anything special
to do this morning?” asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper for the
rabbit gentleman, as she saw him get up from
the breakfast table in his hollow-stump bungalow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anything special? Why, no, I guess not,”
answered the bunny uncle. “I was going out
for a walk, and perhaps I may meet with an adventure
on the way, or I may help some friends
of Mother Goose, as I sometimes do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are always being kind to some one,”
said Nurse Jane, “and that is what I want you
to do now. I have just made an orange cake,
and——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“An orange cake?” cried Uncle Wiggily,
his pink nose twinkling. “How nice! Where
did you get the oranges?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Up on the Orange Mountains, to be sure,”
answered the muskrat lady, with a laugh. “I
have made two orange cakes, to tell the exact
truth, which I always do. There is one for us
and I wanted to send one to Dr. Possum, who
was so good to cure you of the rheumatism,
when the cow with the crumpled horn pulled the
hard cork out of the medicine bottle for us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Send an orange cake to Dr. Possum? The
very thing! Oh, fine!” cried the bunny uncle.
“I’ll take it right over to him. Put it in a basket,
so it will not take cold, Nurse Jane.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The muskrat lady wrapped the orange cake
in a clean napkin, and then put it in the basket
for Uncle Wiggily to carry to Dr. Possum.</p>

<p class='c011'>Off started the old rabbit gentleman, over the
woods and through the fields—oh, excuse me
just a minute. He did not go over the woods
this time. He only did that when he had his
airship, which he was not using to-day, for fear
of spilling the oranges out of the cake. So he
went over the fields and through the woods to
Dr. Possum’s office.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I wonder if I will have any adventure
to-day?” thought the old rabbit gentleman, as
he hopped along. “I hope I do, for——”</p>

<p class='c011'>And then he suddenly stopped thinking and
listened, for he heard a dog barking, and a
voice was sadly saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! It’s too bad, I know it is, but I
can’t help it. It’s that way in the book, so you’ll
have to go hungry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the dog barked again and Uncle Wiggily
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“More trouble for some one. I hope it isn’t
the bad dog who used to bother me. I wonder
if I can help any one?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked around, and, nearby, he saw a
little wooden house on the top of a hill. The
barking and talking was coming from that
house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll go up and see what is the matter,” said
the rabbit gentleman. “Perhaps I can help.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked through a window of the house
before going in, and he saw a lady, somewhat
like Mother Goose, wearing a tall, peaked hat,
like an ice cream cone turned upside down.
And with her was a big dog, who was looking
in an open cupboard and barking. And the
lady was singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Old Mother Hubbard</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Went to the cupboard</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To get her poor dog a bone.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But, when she got there,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The cupboard was bare,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And so the poor dog had none.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“And isn’t there anything else in the house
to eat, except a bone, Mother Hubbard?” the
dog asked. “I’m so hungry!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There isn’t, I’m sorry to say,” she answered.
“But I’ll go to the baker’s to get you some
bread——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And when you come back you will think I
am dead,” said the dog, quickly. “I’ll look so,
anyhow,” he went on, “for I am so hungry.
Isn’t there any way of getting me anything to
eat without going to the baker’s? I don’t care
much for bread, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How would you like a piece of orange
cake?” asked Uncle Wiggily, all of a sudden,
as he walked in Mother Hubbard’s house. “Excuse
me,” said the bunny uncle, “but I could
not help hearing what your dog said. I know
how hard it is to be hungry, and I have an
orange cake in my basket. It is for Dr. Possum,
but I am sure he would be glad to let your dog
have some.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is very kind of you,” said Mother
Hubbard.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I certainly would like orange cake,”
spoke the dog, making a bow and wagging his
nose—I mean his tail.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you shall have it,” said Uncle Wiggily,
opening the basket. He set the orange
cake on the table, and the dog began to eat it,
and Mother Hubbard also ate some, for she was
hungry, too, and, what do you think? Before
Uncle Wiggily, or any one else knew it, the
orange cake was all gone—eaten up—and there
was none for Dr. Possum.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, see what we have done!” cried Mother
Hubbard, sadly. “We have eaten all your
cake, Uncle Wiggily. I’m sure we did not mean
to, but with a hungry dog——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pray do not mention it,” said the rabbit gentleman,
politely. “I know just how it is. I have
another orange cake of my own at home. I’ll
go get that for Dr. Possum. He won’t mind
which one he has.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No. I can’t let you do that,” spoke Mother
Hubbard. “You were too kind to be put to all
that trouble. Next door to me lives Paddy
Kake, the baker-man. I’ll have him bake you
a cake as fast as he can, and you can take that
to Dr. Possum. How will that do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, that will be just fine!” said Uncle
Wiggily, twinkling his pink nose at the dog, who
was licking up the last of the cake crumbs with
his red tongue.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Mother Hubbard went next door, where
lived Paddy Kake, the baker. And she said to
him:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Paddy Kake, Paddy Kake, baker-man,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Bake me a cake as fast as you can.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Into it please put a raisin and plum,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And mark it with D. P. for Dr. Possum.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“I will,” said Paddy Kake. “I’ll do it right
away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And he did, and as soon as the cake was
baked Uncle Wiggily put it in the basket where
the orange one had been, and took it to Dr. Possum,
who was very glad to get it. For the raisin
and plum cake was as good as the orange one
Mother Hubbard and her dog had eaten.</p>

<p class='c011'>So you see everything came out all right after
all, and if the cork doesn’t pop out of the ink
bottle and go to sleep in the middle of the white
bedspread, like our black cat, I’ll tell you next
about Uncle Wiggily and Little Miss Muffet.</p>

  <h2 id='Ch-XVI' class='c013'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND MISS MUFFET</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Rat-a-tat-tat</span>!” came a knock on the door
of the hollow-stump bungalow, where Uncle
Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman, lived
with Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat
lady housekeeper. “Rat-a-tat-tat!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come in,” called Nurse Jane, who was sitting
by a window, mending a pair of Uncle
Wiggily’s socks, which had holes in them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The door opened, and into the bungalow
stepped a little girl. Oh, she was such a tiny
thing that she was not much larger than a doll.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How do you do, Nurse Jane,” said the little
girl, making a low bow, and shaking her curly
hair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, I am very well, thank you,” the muskrat
lady said. “How are you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’m very well, too, Nurse Jane.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! You seem to know me, but I am not
so sure I know you,” said Uncle Wiggily’s
housekeeper. “Are you Little Bo Peep?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Nurse Jane,” answered the little girl,
with a smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you Mistress Mary, quite contrary, how
does your garden grow?” Nurse Jane wanted
to know.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am not Mistress Mary,” answered the little
girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then who are you?” Nurse Jane asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am little Miss Muffet, if you please, and I
have come to sit on a tuffet, and eat some curds
and whey. I want to see Uncle Wiggily, too, before
I go away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right,” spoke Nurse Jane. “I’ll get you
the tuffet and the curds and whey,” and she went
out to the kitchen. The muskrat lady noticed
that Miss Muffet said nothing about the spider
frightening her away.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps she doesn’t like to talk about it,”
thought Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy, “though it’s in the
Mother Goose book. Well, I’ll not say anything,
either.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So she got the tuffet for little Miss Muffet; a
tuffet being a sort of baby footstool. And, indeed,
the little girl had to sit on something quite
small, for her legs were very short.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And here are your curds and whey,” went
on Nurse Jane, bringing in a bowl. Curds and
whey are very good to eat. They are made from
milk, sweetened, and are something like a custard
in a cup.</p>

<p class='c011'>So little Miss Muffet, sat on a tuffet, eating
her curds and whey, just as she ought to have
done.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And,” said Nurse Jane to herself, “I do
hope no spider will come sit beside her to
frighten Miss Muffet away, before Uncle Wiggily
sees her, for she is a dear little child.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Pretty soon some one was heard hopping up
the front steps of the bungalow, and Nurse Jane
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is Uncle Wiggily now, I think.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’m glad!” exclaimed little Miss Muffet,
as she handed the muskrat lady the empty
bowl of curds and whey. “I want to see him
very specially.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In came hopping the nice old rabbit gentleman,
and he knew Little Miss Muffet right
away, and was very glad to see her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” cried the little girl.
“I have been waiting to see you. I want you to
do me a very special extra favor; will you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, of course, if I can,” answered the
bunny uncle, with a polite bow. “I am always
glad to do favors.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You can easily do this one,” said Little Miss
Muffet. “I want you to come——”</p>

<p class='c011'>And just then Uncle Wiggily saw a big spider
crawling over the floor toward the little girl, who
was still on her tuffet, having finished her curds
and whey.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And if she sees that spider, sit down beside
her, it surely will frighten her away,” thought
Uncle Wiggily, “and I will not be able to find
out what she wants me to do for her. Let me
see, she hasn’t yet noticed the spider. I wonder
if I could get her out of the room while I asked
the spider to kindly not to do any frightening,
at least for a while?”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Uncle Wiggily, who was quite worried,
sort of waved his paw sideways at the spider, and
twinkled his pink nose and said “Ahem!”
which meant that the spider was to keep on
crawling, and not go near Miss Muffet. Uncle
Wiggily himself was not afraid of spiders.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Uncle Wiggily,” went on little Miss
Muffet, who had not yet seen the spider. “I
want you to come to——” and then she saw the
rabbit gentleman making funny noses behind
her back, and waving his paw at something, and
Miss Muffet cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, what in the world is the matter, Uncle
Wiggily? Have you hurt yourself?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no,” the rabbit gentleman quickly exclaimed.
“It’s the spider. She’s crawling toward
you, and I don’t want her to sit down beside
you, and frighten you away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Little Miss Muffet laughed a jolly laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” she cried. “I’m not
at all afraid of spiders! I’d let a dozen of them
sit beside me if they wanted to, for I know they
will not harm me, if I do not harm them. And
besides, I knew this spider was coming all the
while.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You did?” cried Nurse Jane, surprised like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To be sure I did. She is Mrs. Spin-Spider,
and she has come to measure me for a new cobweb
silk dress; haven’t you, Mrs. Spin-Spider?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, child, I have,” answered the lady spider.
“No one need be afraid of me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m not,” Uncle Wiggily said, “only I did
not want you to frighten Miss Muffet away before
she had her curds and whey.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I had them,” the little girl said. “Nurse
Jane gave them to me before you came in, Uncle
Wiggily. But now let me tell you what I came
for, and then Mrs. Spin-Spider can measure me
for a new dress. I came to ask if you would do
me the favor to come to my birthday party next
week. Will you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course I will!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“I’ll be delighted.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good!” laughed Little Miss Muffet. Then
along came Mrs. Spin-Spider, and sat down beside
her and did not frighten the little girl away,
but, instead, measured her for a new dress.</p>

<p class='c011'>So from this we may learn that cobwebs are
good for something else than catching flies, and
in the next chapter, if the piano doesn’t come upstairs
to lie down on the brass bed so the pillow
has to go down in the coal bin to sleep, I’ll tell
you about Uncle Wiggily and the first little kitten.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='Ch-XVII' class='c013'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE FIRST KITTEN</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily Longears</span>, the nice old rabbit
gentleman, was asleep in his easy chair by
the fire which burned brightly on the hearth in
his hollow-stump bungalow. Mr. Longears
was dreaming that he had just eaten a piece of
cherry pie for lunch, and that the cherry pits
were dropping on the floor with a “rat-a-tat-tat!”
when he suddenly awakened and heard
some one knocking on the front door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! Who is there? Come in!” cried the
rabbit gentleman, hardly awake yet. Then he
happened to think:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope it isn’t the bad fox, or the skillery-scalery
alligator, whom I have invited in. I
ought not to have been so quick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But it was none of these unpleasant creatures
who had knocked on Uncle Wiggily’s door. It
was Mrs. Purr, the nice cat lady, and when the
rabbit gentleman had let her in she looked so sad
and sorrowful that he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the matter, Mrs. Purr? Has anything
happened?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed there has, Mr. Longears,” the cat
lady answered. “You know my three little kittens,
don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, yes, I know them,” replied the bunny
uncle. “They are Fuzzo, Muzzo and Wuzzo.
I hope they are not ill?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, they are not ill,” said the cat lady, mewing
sadly, “but they have run away, and I came
to see if you would help me get them back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Run away! Your dear little kittens!” cried
Uncle Wiggily. “You don’t mean it! How
did it happen?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, you know my little kittens had each a
new pair of mittens,” said Mrs. Purr.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I read about that in the Mother Goose
book,” said the rabbit gentleman. “It must be
nice to have new mittens.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My little kittens thought so,” went on Mrs.
Purr. “Their grandmother, Pussy Cat Mole,
knitted them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have met Pussy Cat Mole,” said Uncle
Wiggily. “After she jumped over a coal, and
in her best petticoat burned a great hole, I helped
her mend it so she could go to the party.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I heard about that; it was very good of you,”
mewed Mrs. Purr. “But about my little kittens,
when they got their mittens, what do you think
they did?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, I suppose they went out and played in
the snow,” Uncle Wiggily said. “I know that
is what I would have done, when I was a little
rabbit, if I had had a new pair of mittens.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I only wish they had done that,” Mrs. Purr
said. “But, instead, they went and ate some
cherry pie. The red pie-juice got all over their
new mittens, and when they saw it they became
afraid I would scold them, and they ran away.
I was not home when they ate the pie and soiled
their mittens, but the cat lady who lives next door
told me.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now I want to know if you will try to find
my three little kittens for me; Fuzzo, Wuzzo
and Muzzo? I want them to come home so
badly!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll go look for them,” promised the old rabbit
gentleman. So taking his red, white and blue
rheumatism crutch, off he started over the fields
and through the woods. Mrs. Purr went back
home to get supper, in case her kittens, with
their pie-soiled mittens, should come back by
themselves before Uncle Wiggily found them.</p>

<p class='c011'>On and on went the old rabbit gentleman.
He looked on all sides and through the middle
for any signs of the lost kittens, but he saw none
for quite a while. Then, all at once, he heard a
mewing sound over in the bushes, and he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! There is the first little kitten!” And
there, surely enough she was—Fuzzo!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” Fuzzo was saying, “I don’t believe
I’ll ever get them clean!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s the matter now?” asked the rabbit
gentleman, though he knew quite well what it
was, and only pretended he did not. “Who are
you and what is the matter?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’m in such trouble,” said the first little
kitten. “My sisters and I ate some pie in our
new mittens. We soiled them badly with the
red pie-juice. Weren’t we naughty kittens?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, perhaps just a little bit naughty,”
Uncle Wiggily said. “But you should not have
run away from your mamma. She feels very
badly. Where are Muzzo and Wuzzo?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know!” answered Fuzzo. “They
ran one way and I ran another. I’m trying to
get the pie-juice out of my mittens, but I can’t
seem to do it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How did you try?” Uncle Wiggily wanted
to know.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am rubbing my mittens up and down on
the rough bark of trees and on stones,” answered
Fuzzo. “I thought that would take the pie
stains out, but it doesn’t.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course not!” laughed Uncle Wiggily.
“Now you come with me. I am going to take
you home. Your mother sent me to look for
you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, but I’m afraid to go home,” mewed
Fuzzo. “My mother will scold me for soiling
my nice, new mittens. It says so in the book.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, she won’t!” laughed Uncle Wiggily.
“You just leave it to me. But first you come
to my hollow-stump bungalow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Fuzzo, the first little kitten, put one paw
in Uncle Wiggily’s, and carrying her mittens
in the other, along they went together.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where are you, Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy?” called the rabbit gentleman, when
they reached his hollow-stump bungalow. “I
want you to make some nice, hot, soapy suds and
water, and wash this first little kitten’s mittens.
Then they will be clean, and she can take them
home with her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the muskrat lady made some nice, hot, soap-bubbily
suds and in them she washed the kitten’s
mittens. Then, when they were dry, Uncle Wiggily
took the mittens, and also Fuzzo to Mrs.
Purr’s house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, how glad I am to have you back!” cried
the cat mother. “I wouldn’t have scolded you,
Fuzzo, for soiling your mittens. You must not
be afraid any more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I won’t,” promised the first little kitten,
showing her nice, clean mittens.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then Uncle Wiggily said he would go
find the other two lost baby cats. And so, if the
milkman doesn’t put goldfish in the ink bottle,
to make the puppy dog laugh when he goes to
bed, I’ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and
the second kittie.</p>

  <h2 id='Ch-XVIII' class='c013'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE SECOND KITTEN</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Well</span>, where are you going now, Uncle
Wiggily?” asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy,
the muskrat lady housekeeper, of the rabbit gentleman,
one day as she saw him starting out of
his hollow-stump bungalow, after he had found
the first of the little kittens who had soiled their
mittens.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am going to look for the second little lost
kitten,” replied the bunny uncle, “though where
she may be I don’t know. Her name is Muzzo.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, her name is almost like mine, isn’t it?”
asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A little like it,” said Uncle Wiggily. “Poor
little Muzzo! She and the other two kittens ran
off after they had soiled their mittens, eating
cherry pie when their mother, Mrs. Purr, was
not at home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is very good of you to go looking for
them,” said Nurse Jane.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I just love to do things like that,” spoke
the rabbit gentleman. “Well, good-by. I’ll see
if I can’t find the second kitten now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Away started the rabbit gentleman, over the
fields and through the woods, looking on all
sides for the second lost kitten, whose name was
Muzzo.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where are you, kittie?” called Uncle Wiggily.
“Where are you, Muzzo? Come to me!
Never mind if your mittens are soiled by cherry-pie-juice.
I’ll find a way to clean them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But no Muzzo answered. Uncle Wiggily
looked everywhere, under bushes and in the tree
tops; for sometimes kitty cats climb trees, you
know; but no Muzzo could he find. Then
Uncle Wiggily walked a little farther, and he
saw Billie Wagtail, the goat boy, butting his
head in a snow-bank.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are you doing, Billie?” asked the rabbit
gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, just having some fun,” answered Billie,
standing up on his hind legs.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You haven’t seen a little lost kitten, with
cherry-pie-juice on her new mittens, have you?”
asked the rabbit gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I am sorry to say I have not,” said Billie,
politely. “Did you lose one?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, she lost herself,” said Uncle Wiggily,
and he told about Muzzo.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll help you look for her,” offered the goat
boy, so he and Uncle Wiggily started off together
to try to find poor little lost Muzzo, and
bring her home to her mother, Mrs. Purr.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pretty soon, as the rabbit gentleman and the
goat boy were walking along they heard a little
mewing cry behind a pile of snow, and Uncle
Wiggily said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“That sounds like Muzzo now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps it is. Let’s look,” said Billie Wagtail.</p>

<p class='c011'>He and the bunny uncle looked over the pile
of snow, and there, surely enough, they saw a
little white pussy cat sitting on a stone, looking
at her mittens, which were all covered with red
pie-juice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” the little pussy was saying.
“I don’t know how to get them clean! What
shall I do? I can’t go home with my mittens all
soiled, or my mamma will whip me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course, Mrs. Purr, the cat lady, would not
do anything like that, but Muzzo thought she
would.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are you trying to do to clean your
mittens, Muzzo?” asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, how you surprised me!” exclaimed the
second little lost kitten. “I did not know you
were here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Billie Wagtail and I came to look for you,”
said Uncle Wiggily. “But what about your
mittens?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I have been dipping them in snow, trying
to clean them,” said Muzzo. “Only the
pie-juice will not come out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course not,” spoke Uncle Wiggily, with
a laugh. “It needs hot soap suds and water to
clean them. You come home to my bungalow
and we will get some.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I am so cold and tired I can’t go another
step,” said the second little kitten, who had run
away from home after she soiled her mittens.
“I just can’t.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, then, I don’t know how you are going
to get your mittens washed, out here in the cold
and snow,” said the rabbit gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! I know a way!” said Billie Wagtail,
the goat boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How?” asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll get an empty tomato can,” spoke Billie.
“I know where there is one, for I was eating
the paper off it, to get the paste, just before you
came along.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Goats like to eat paper off tomato cans, you
know, because the paper is stuck on with sweet
paste, and that is as good to goat children as
candy is to you.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll go get the tomato can,” said Billie, “and
you can make a fire, Uncle Wiggily.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And then what?” asked the rabbit gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then we will melt some snow, and make
some hot water,” went on Billie. “I have a cake
of soap in my pocket, that I just bought at the
store for my mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>“With the hot water in the can, and the soap,
we can make a suds, and wash Muzzo’s mittens
out here as well as at your bungalow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So we can, Billie!” cried the bunny uncle.
“You go get the empty tomato tin and I’ll make
the fire. You needn’t try to wash your soiled
mittens in the snow any more, Muzzo,” he said
to the second lost kittie. “We will do it for you,
in soapy water, which is better.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon Uncle Wiggily made a fire. Back came
Billie Wagtail with the tomato can. Some snow
was put in it, and it was set over the blaze. Soon
the snow melted into water, and then when the
water was hot Uncle Wiggily made a soapy suds
as Nurse Jane had done.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now I can wash my mittens!” cried Muzzo,
and she did. And when they were nice and
clean she went home with them, and oh! how
glad her mother was to see her!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never run away again, Muzzo,” said the
cat lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I won’t,” promised the kitten. “But where
is Wuzzo?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is still lost,” said Mrs. Purr.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I will go find her, too,” said Uncle
Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>And if the apple pie doesn’t go out snowballing
with the piece of cheese, and forget to come
back to dinner, I’ll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and the third little kitten.</p>

  <h2 id='Ch-XIX' class='c013'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE THIRD KITTEN</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily Longears</span>, the nice old
gentleman rabbit, came walking slowly up the
front path that led to his hollow-stump bungalow.
He was limping a little on his red, white
and blue-striped barber-pole rheumatism crutch
that Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat
lady housekeeper, had gnawed for him out of a
corn-stalk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’m glad to be home again,” said the
rabbit uncle, sitting down on the front porch to
rest a minute. And just then the door in the
hollow stump opened, and Nurse Jane, looking
out, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, here he is now, Mrs. Purr.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With that a cat lady came to the door and she
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily! I thought you never
would come back. Did you find her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Find who?” asked the rabbit gentleman.
“I was not looking for any one. I have just
been down to Lincoln Park to see some squirrels
who live in a hollow tree. They are second
cousins to Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, the
squirrels who live in our woods. I had a nice
visit with them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you didn’t find Wuzzo, my third little
lost kitten, did you?” asked Mrs. Purr, the cat
mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What! Is Wuzzo still lost?” asked the
bunny uncle, in great surprise. “I thought she
had come home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, she hasn’t,” said Mrs. Purr. “You
know you found my other kittens, Fuzzo
and Muzzo, for me, but Wuzzo, the third little
kitten, is still lost. She has been away all night,
and I came over here the first thing this morning
to see if you would not kindly go look for her.
But you had already left and I have been waiting
here ever since for you to come back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I stayed longer with the park squirrels
than I meant to,” said Uncle Wiggily. “But
now I am back I will start off and try to find
Wuzzo. It’s too bad your three little kittens ran
away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They had, you know, as I told you in the two
stories before this one. The three little kittens
ate cherry pie with their new mittens on. And
they soiled their mittens. Then they were so
afraid their mother, Mrs. Purr, would scold
them that they all ran away.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Mrs. Purr was a kind cat, and would not
have scolded at all. And when she found her
little kittens were gone she asked Uncle Wiggily
to find them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you did find the first two, Fuzzo and
Muzzo,” said the cat lady. “So I am sure you
can find the third one, Wuzzo.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope I can,” Uncle Wiggily said. “I remember
now I started off to find her, but my
rheumatism hurt me so I had to come back to
my bungalow. Then I forgot all about Wuzzo.
But I’m all right now, and I’ll start off.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So away over the fields and through the woods
went Uncle Wiggily, looking for the third little
lost kitten. When he had found the two others
he had helped them wash the pie-juice off their
mittens, so they were nice and clean. And then
the kittens were not afraid to go home.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily looked all over for the third
little kitten, under bushes, up in trees (for cats
climb trees, you know), and even behind big
rocks Uncle Wiggily looked. But no Wuzzo
could he find.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last, when the rabbit gentleman came to a
big hollow log that was lying on the ground, he
sat down on it to rest, and, all of a sudden, he
heard a voice inside the log speaking. And the
voice asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pussy cat, pussy cat, where have you been?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve been to London to see the Queen,” answered
another voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pussy cat, pussy cat, what did you do
there?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I frightened a little mouse, under her chair,”
came the answer, and this time it was a little
pussy cat kitten speaking, Uncle Wiggily was
certain.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old rabbit gentleman looked in one end
of the hollow log, and there surely enough, he
saw Wuzzo, the third lost kitten.</p>

<p class='c011'>And besides Wuzzo, Uncle Wiggily saw
Neddie Stubtail, the little bear boy, who always
slept in a hollow log all Winter. But this time
Neddie was awake, for it was near Spring.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wuzzo, Wuzzo! Is that you? What are
you doing there?” asked Uncle Wiggily.
“Don’t you know your poor mother is looking
all over for you, and that she has sent me to
find you? Why don’t you come home?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I—I’m afraid to,” said Wuzzo, crawling
out of the hollow log, and Neddie, the boy bear
also crawled out, saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hello, Uncle Wiggily!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How do you do, Neddie,” spoke the bunny
uncle. “How long has Wuzzo been staying
with you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She just ran in my hollow log,” said the little
bear chap, “and her tail, brushing against my
nose, tickled me so that I sneezed and awakened
from my Winter sleep.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where have you been all night, since you
ran away, Wuzzo?” asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” answered the third little kitten.
“After Fuzzo, Muzzo and I soiled our mittens
with cherry pie we all ran away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I know that part,” spoke the bunny
uncle. “It was not right to do, but I have found
the two other lost kitties. I couldn’t find you,
though. Why was that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because I met Mother Goose,” said Wuzzo,
“and she asked me to go to London to see the
Queen. She took me through the air on the
back of her big gander, and we flew as quickly
as you could have gone in your airship.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You went to London to see the Queen!” exclaimed
Uncle Wiggily, in surprise. “Well,
well! What did you do there?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I frightened a little mouse under her chair,
just as Mother Goose wanted me to do,” said
Wuzzo. “Then the big gander flew with me to
these woods and went back to get Mother Goose,
who stayed to talk with the Queen. So here I
am, but I don’t know the way home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’ll take you home all right,” said Uncle
Wiggily. “But first we must wash your mittens.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I did that for her, in the log,” said Neddie
Stubtail, laughing. “With my red tongue
I licked off all the sweet cherry-pie-juice, which
I liked very much. So, now the mittens are
clean.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good!” cried the bunny uncle. “Now we
will go to your mother, Wuzzo. She will be
glad to know that you frightened a little mouse
under the Queen’s chair.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Uncle Wiggily took the third little kitten
home, and thus they were all found. And if the
cat on our roof doesn’t jump down the chimney,
and scare the lemon pie so it turns into an apple
dumpling, I’ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily
and the Jack horse.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='Ch-XX' class='c013'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE JACK HORSE</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Well</span>, where are you going to-day, Uncle
Wiggily?” asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy, the muskrat
lady housekeeper, as she saw the rabbit
gentleman putting on his tall silk hat, and taking
his red, white and blue-striped rheumatism
crutch down off the mantel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am going over to see Nannie and Billy
Wagtail, the goat children,” answered the bunny
uncle. “I have not seen them in a long while.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But they’ll be at school,” said Nurse Jane.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll wait until they come home, then,” said
Uncle Wiggily. “And while I’m waiting I’ll
talk to Uncle Butter, the nice old gentleman
goat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So off started Uncle Wiggily over the fields
and through the woods.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pretty soon he came to the house where the
family of Wagtail goats lived. They were given
that name because they wagged their little short
tails so very fast, sometimes up and down, and
again sideways.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, how do you do, Uncle Wiggily?”
asked Mrs. Wagtail, as she opened the door for
the rabbit gentleman. “Come and sit down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” he answered. “I called to see
Nannie and Billie. But I suppose they are at
school.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, they are studying their lessons.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’ll come in then, and talk to Uncle
Butter, for I suppose you are busy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I am, but not too busy to talk to you,
Mr. Longears,” said the goat lady. “Uncle
Butter is away, pasting up some circus posters
on the billboard, and I wish he’d come back, for
I want him to go to the store for me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Couldn’t I go?” asked Uncle Wiggily, politely.
“I have nothing special to do, and I often
go to the store for Nurse Jane. I’d like to go
for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well, you may,” said Mrs. Wagtail.
“I want for supper some papers off a tomato
can, and a few more off a can of corn, and here
is a basket to put them in. And you might bring
a bit of brown paper, so I can make soup of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will,” said Uncle Wiggily, starting off
with the basket on his paw. Goats, you know,
like the papers that come off cans, as the papers
have sweet paste on them. And they also like
brown grocery paper itself, for it has straw in
it, and goats like straw. Of course, goats eat
other things besides paper, though.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily was going carefully along,
for there was ice and snow on the ground, and
it was slippery, and he did not want to fall. Soon
he was at the paper store, where he bought what
Mrs. Wagtail wanted.</p>

<p class='c011'>And on the way back to the goat lady’s house
something happened to the old rabbit gentleman.
As he stepped over a big icicle he put his foot
down on a slippery snowball some little animal
chap had left on the path, and, all of a sudden,
bango! down went Uncle Wiggily, basket of
paper, rheumatism crutch and all.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ouch!” cried the rabbit gentleman, “I fear
something is broken,” for he heard a cracking
sound as he fell.</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked at his paws and legs and felt of
his big ears. They seemed all right. Then he
looked at the basket of paper. That was
crumpled up, but not broken, and the bunny
uncle’s tall silk hat, while it had a few dents in,
was not smashed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! It’s my rheumatism crutch,”
cried Uncle Wiggily. “It’s broken in two,
and how am I ever going to walk without it
this slippery day I don’t see. Oh, my goodness
me sakes alive and some bang-bang tooth powder!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Carefully the rabbit gentleman arose, but as
he had no red, white and blue-striped crutch to
lean on, he nearly fell again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess I’d better stay sitting down,” thought
Uncle Wiggily. “Perhaps some one may come
along, and I can ask them go get Nurse Jane
to gnaw for me another rheumatism crutch out
of a corn-stalk. I’ll wait here until help comes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily waited quite a while, but no
one passed by.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It will soon be time for Billie and Nannie
Wagtail to pass by on their way from school,”
thought the bunny uncle. “I could send them
for another crutch, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he waited a little longer, and then, as no one
came, he tried to walk with his broken crutch.
But he could not. Then Uncle Wiggily cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Help! Help! Help!” but still no one
came. “Oh, dear!” said the rabbit gentleman,
“if only Mother Goose would fly past, riding
on the back of her gander, she might take me
home.” He looked up, but Mother Goose was
not sweeping cobwebs out of the sky that day,
so he did not see her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, all of a sudden, as the rabbit gentleman
sat there, wondering how he was going to
walk on the slippery ice and snow without his
crutch to help him, he heard a jolly voice singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ride a Jack horse to Banbury Cross,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To see an old lady jump on a white horse.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>With rings on her fingers and bells on her toes,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>She shall have music wherever she goes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>And with that along through the woods came
riding a nice, old lady on a rocking-horse. And
on the side of the rocking-horse was painted in
red ink the name:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><b>JACK</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Why, hello, Uncle Wiggily!” called the
nice old lady, shaking her toes and making the
bells jingle a pretty tune. “What is the matter
with you?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I am in such trouble,” replied the bunny
uncle. “I fell down on a slippery snowball, and
broke my crutch. Without it I cannot walk,
and I want to take these papers to Mrs. Wagtail,
the goat lady, to eat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! If that is all your trouble I can soon
fix matters!” cried the jolly old lady. “Here,
get up beside me on my Jack horse, and I’ll ride
you to Mrs. Wagtail’s, and then take you home
to your hollow-stump bungalow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, will you? How kind!” said Uncle
Wiggily. “Thank you! But have you the
time?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lots of time,” laughed the old lady. “It
doesn’t really matter when I get to Banbury
Cross. Come on!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily got up on the back of the
Jack horse, behind the old lady. She tinkled
the rings on her fingers and jingled the bells on
her toes, and so, of course, she’ll have music
wherever she goes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just as the Mother Goose books says,” spoke
the bunny uncle. “Oh, I’m glad you came
along.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So am I,” said the nice old lady. Then she
took Uncle Wiggily to the Wagtail house,
where he left the basket of papers, and next he
rode on the Jack horse to his bungalow, and,
after the bunny uncle had thanked the old lady,
she, herself, rode on to Banbury Cross, to see
another old lady jump on a white horse. And
very nicely she did it too, let me tell you.</p>

<p class='c011'>So everything came out all right, and in the
next chapter, if the apple pie doesn’t turn a
somersault and crack its crust so the juice runs
out, I’ll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and the
clock-mouse.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='Ch-XXI' class='c013'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE CLOCK-MOUSE</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily Longears</span>, the nice old rabbit
gentleman, sat in an easy chair in his hollow-stump
bungalow. He had just eaten a nice
lunch, which Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the
muskrat lady housekeeper, had put on the table
for him, and he was feeling a bit sleepy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you going out this afternoon?” asked
Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy, as she cleared away the
dishes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hum! Ho! Well, I hardly know,” Uncle
Wiggily answered, in a sleepy voice. “I may,
after I have a little nap.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your new red, white and blue-striped
rheumatism crutch is ready for you,” went on
Nurse Jane. “I gnawed it for you out of a fine
large corn-stalk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily had broken his other crutch,
if you will kindly remember, when he slipped
as he was coming back from the store, where
he went for Mrs. Wagtail, the goat lady. And
it was so slippery that the rabbit gentleman
never would have gotten home, only he rode
on a Jack horse with the lady, who had rings
on her fingers and bells on her toes, as I told you
in the story before this one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you for making me a new crutch,
Nurse Jane,” spoke the bunny uncle. “If I go
out I’ll take it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he went to sleep in his easy chair, but
he was suddenly awakened by hearing the
bungalow clock strike one. Then, as he sat up
and rubbed his eyes with his paws, Uncle Wiggily
heard a thumping noise on the hall floor
and a little voice squeaked out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ouch! I’ve hurt my leg! Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My! I wonder what that can be? It
seemed to come out of my clock,” spoke Mr.
Longears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did come out of your clock,” said some
one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You did? Who are you, if you please?”
asked the bunny uncle, looking all around. “I
can’t see you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s because I’m so small,” was the answer.
“But here I am, right by the table. I
can’t walk as my leg is hurt.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily looked, and saw a little mouse,
who was holding his left hind leg in his right
front paw.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who are you?” asked the bunny uncle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am Hickory Dickory Dock, the mouse,”
was the answer. “And I am a clock-mouse.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A clock-mouse!” exclaimed Uncle Wiggily,
in surprise. “I never heard of such a
thing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, don’t you remember me? I’m in
Mother Goose’s book. This is how it goes:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Hickory Dickory Dock,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The mouse ran up the clock.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The clock struck one,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And down he come,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Hickory Dickory Dock!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“Oh, now I remember you,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“And so you are a clock-mouse.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I ran up your clock, and then when the
clock struck one, down I had to come. But I
ran down so fast that I tripped over the pendulum.
The clock reached down its hands and
tried to catch me, but it had no eyes in its face
to see me, so I slipped, anyhow, and I hurt my
leg.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’m sorry to hear that,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“Perhaps I can fix it for you. Nurse
Jane, bring me some salve for Hickory Dickory
Dock, the clock-mouse,” he called.</p>

<p class='c011'>The muskrat lady brought some salve, and,
with a rag, Uncle Wiggily bound up the leg of
the clock-mouse so it did not hurt so much.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I’ll lend you a piece of my old crutch,
so you can hobble along on it,” said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” spoke Hickory Dickory Dock,
the clock-mouse. “You have been very kind
to me, and some day, I hope, I may do you a
favor. If I can I will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” Uncle Wiggily said. Then
Hickory Dickory Dock limped away, but in a
few days he was better, and he could run up
more clocks, and run down when they struck
one.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was about a week after this that Uncle Wiggily
went walking through the woods on his
way to see Grandfather Goosey Gander. And
just before he reached his friend’s house he met
Mother Goose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily,” she said, swinging
her cobweb broom up and down, “I want to
thank you for being so kind to Hickory Dickory
Dock, the clock-mouse.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was a pleasure to be kind to him,” said
Uncle Wiggily. “Is he all better now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, he is all well again,” replied Mother
Goose. “He is coming to run up and down
your clock again soon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll be glad to see him,” said Uncle Wiggily.
Then he went to call on Grandpa Goosey,
and he told about Hickory Dickory Dock, falling
down from out the clock.</p>

<p class='c011'>On his way back to his hollow-stump bungalow,
Uncle Wiggily took a short cut through
the woods. And, as he was passing along, his
paw slipped and he became all tangled up in a
wild grape vine, which was like a lot of ropes, all
twisted together into hard knots.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “I’m
caught!” The more he tried to untangle himself
the tighter he was held fast, until it seemed
he would never get out.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh!” cried the rabbit gentleman. “This
is terrible. Will no one come to get me out?
Help! Help! Will some one please help me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I will help you, Uncle Wiggily,” answered
a kind, little squeaking voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who are you?” asked the rabbit gentleman,
moving a piece of the grape vine away from his
nose, so he could speak plainly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am Hickory Dickory Dock, the clock-mouse,”
was the answer, “and with my sharp
teeth I will gnaw the grape vine in many pieces
so you will be free.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That will be very kind of you,” said Uncle
Wiggily, who was quite tired out with his struggles
to get loose.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Hickory Dickory Dock, with his sharp
teeth, gnawed the grape vine, and, in a little
while, Uncle Wiggily was loose and all right
again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” said the bunny uncle to the
clock-mouse, as he hopped off, and Hickory
Dickory Dock went with him, for his leg was
all better now. “Thank you very much, nice
little clock-mouse.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You did me a favor,” said Hickory Dickory
Dock, “and now I have done you one, so we are
even.” And that’s a good way to be in this
world. So, if the ink bottle doesn’t turn pale
when it sees the fountain pen jump in the goldfish
bowl and swim I’ll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and the late scholar.</p>

  <h2 id='Ch-XXII' class='c013'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE LATE SCHOLAR</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Heigh-ho</span>!” cried Uncle Wiggily Longears,
the nice rabbit gentleman, one morning,
as he hopped from bed and went to the window
of his hollow-stump bungalow to look out.
“Heigh-ho! It will soon be Spring, I hope, for
I am tired of Winter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he went down-stairs, where Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper,
had his breakfast ready on the table.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily ate some cabbage pancakes
with carrot maple sugar sprinkled over them,
and then as he wiped his whiskers on his red
tongue, which he used for a napkin, and as he
twinkled his pink nose to see if it was all right,
Nurse Jane said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yesterday, Uncle Wiggily, you told me you
would like me to make some lettuce cakes to-day;
did you not?”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/p146.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c011'>“I did,” answered Uncle Wiggily, sort of
slow and solemn like. “But what is the matter,
Nurse Jane? I hope you are not going to tell
me that you cannot, or will not, make those lettuce
cakes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’ll make them, all right enough,
Wiggy,” the muskrat lady answered, “only I
have no lettuce. You will have to go to the store
for me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And right gladly will I go!” exclaimed the
bunny uncle, speaking like some one in an old-fashioned
story book. “I’ll get my automobile
out and go at once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily had not used his machine
often that Winter, as there had been so much
snow and ice. But now it was getting close to
Spring and the weather was very nice. There
was no snow in the woods and fields, though,
of course, some might fall later.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It will do my auto good to have me ride in
it,” said the bunny uncle. He blew some hot air
in the bologna sausage tires, put some talcum
powder on the steering-wheel so it would not
catch cold, and then, having tickled the whizzicum-whazzicum
with a goose feather, away
he started for the lettuce store.</p>

<p class='c011'>It did not take him long to get there, and, having
bought a nice head of the green stuff, the
bunny uncle started back again for his hollow-stump
bungalow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nurse Jane will make some fine lettuce
cakes, with clover ice cream cones on top,” he
said to himself, as he hurried along in his automobile.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had not gone very far, and he was about
halfway home, when from behind a bush he
heard the sound of crying. Now, whenever
Uncle Wiggily heard any one crying he knew
some one was in trouble, and as he always tried
to help those in trouble, he did it this time.
Stopping his automobile, he called:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who are you, and what is the matter? Perhaps
I can help you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Out from behind the bush came a boy, a nice
sort of boy, except that he was crying.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, are you Simple Simon?” asked Uncle
Wiggily, “and are you crying because you cannot
catch a whale in your mother’s water pail?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; I am not Simple Simon,” was the answer
of the boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, you cannot be Jack Horner, because
you have no pie with you, and you’re not Little
Boy Blue, because I see you wear a red necktie,”
went on the bunny uncle. “Do you belong to
Mother Goose at all?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” answered the boy. “I do. You must
have heard about me. I am Diller-a-Dollar, a
ten o’clock scholar, why do you come so soon?
I used to come at ten o’clock, but now I’ll come
at noon. Don’t you know me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! Why, of course, I know you!” cried
Uncle Wiggily, in his jolly voice, as he put some
lollypop oil on the doodle-oodleum of his auto.
“But, why are you crying?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because I’m going to be late at school
again,” said the boy. “You see of late I have
been late a good many mornings, but this morning
I got up early, and was sure I would get
there before noon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And so you will, if you hurry,” Uncle Wiggily
said, looking at his watch, that was a cousin
to the clock, up which, and down which, ran
Hickory Dickory Dock, the mouse. “It isn’t
anywhere near noon yet,” went on the rabbit
gentleman. “You can almost get to school on
time this morning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I suppose I could,” said the boy, “and I
got up early on purpose to do that. But now
I have lost my way, and I don’t know where the
school is. Oh, dear! Boo hoo! I’ll never get
to school this week, I fear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, you will!” said Uncle Wiggily,
still more kindly. “I’ll tell you what to do.
Hop up in the automobile here with me, and I’ll
take you to the school. I know just where it is.
Sammie and Susie Littletail, my rabbit friends,
and Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, the squirrels,
as well as Nannie and Billie Wagtail, the goats,
go there. Hop in!”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Diller-a-Dollar, the late scholar, hopped in
the auto, and he and Uncle Wiggily started off
together.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ll not be late this morning,” said the
bunny uncle. “I’ll get you there just about nine
o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, Uncle Wiggily meant to do it, and he
might have, only for what happened. First a
hungry dog bit a piece out of one of the bologna
sausage tires on the auto wheels, and they had
to go slower. Then a hungry cat took another
piece and they had to go still more slowly.</p>

<p class='c011'>A little farther on the tinkerum-tankerum of
the automobile, which drinks gasolene, grew
thirsty and Uncle Wiggily had to give it a glass
of lemonade. This took more time.</p>

<p class='c011'>And finally when the machine went over a
bump the cork came out of the box of talcum
powder and it flew in the face of Uncle Wiggily
and the late scholar and they both sneezed
so hard that the auto stopped.</p>

<p class='c011'>“See! I told you we’d never get to school,”
sadly said the boy. “Oh, dear! And I thought
this time teacher would not laugh, and ask me
why I came so soon, when I was really late.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s too bad!” Uncle Wiggily said. “I did
hope I could get you there on time. But wait a
minute. Let me think. Ha! I have it! We
are close to my bungalow. We’ll run there and
get in my airship. That goes ever so much faster
than my auto, and I’ll have you to school in no
time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>No sooner said than done! In the airship the
late scholar and Uncle Wiggily reached school
just as the nine o’clock bell was ringing, and so
Diller-a-Dollar was on time this time after all.
And the teacher said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Diller-a-Dollar, my ten o’clock scholar,
you may stand up in line. You used to come in
very late, but now you come at nine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the late scholar was not late after all, thanks
to Uncle Wiggily, and if the egg beater doesn’t
go to sleep in the rice pudding, where it can’t
get out to go sleigh-riding with the potato
masher, I’ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily
and Baa-Baa, the black sheep.</p>

  <h2 id='Ch-XXIII' class='c013'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND BAA-BAA BLACK SHEEP</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>My</span> goodness! But it’s cold to-day!” exclaimed
Uncle Wiggily Longears, the nice rabbit
gentleman, as he came down to breakfast in
his hollow-stump bungalow one morning. “It
is very cold.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed it is,” said Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper, as she
put the hot buttered cabbage cakes on the table.
“If you go out you had better wear your fur
coat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall,” spoke the bunny uncle. “And I
probably shall call on Mother Goose. She asked
me to stop in the next time I went past.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What for?” Nurse Jane wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Little Jack Horner hurt his thumb the
last time he pulled a plum out of his Christmas
pie, and Mother Goose wanted me to look at
it, and see if she had better call in Dr. Possum.
So I’ll stop and have a look.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, give her my love,” said Nurse Jane,
and Uncle Wiggily promised that he would.</p>

<p class='c011'>A little later he started off across the fields and
through the woods to the place where Mother
Goose lived, not far from his own hollow-stump
bungalow. Uncle Wiggily had on his fur overcoat,
for it was cold. It had been warm the day
before, when he had taken Diller-a-Dollar, the
ten o’clock scholar, to school, but now the
weather had turned cold again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come in!” called Mother Goose, when
Uncle Wiggily had tapped with his paw on her
door. “Come in!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The bunny uncle went in, and looked at the
thumb of Little Jack Horner, who was playing
marbles with Little Boy Blue.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Does your thumb hurt you much, Jack?”
asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I am sorry to say it does. I’m not going
to pull any more plums out of Christmas pies.
I’m going to eat cake instead,” said Jack Horner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’ll go get Dr. Possum for you,” offered
Uncle Wiggily. “I think that will be
best,” he remarked to Mother Goose.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wrapped in his warm fur overcoat, Uncle
Wiggily once more started off over the fields
and through the woods. He had not gone very
far before he heard a queer sort of crying noise,
like:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Baa! Baa! Baa!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! That sounds like a little lost lamb,”
said the bunny uncle, “only there are no little
lambs out this time of year. I’ll take a look. It
may be some one in trouble, whom I can help.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily looked around the corner of
a stone fence, and there he saw a sheep shivering
in the cold, for most of his warm, fleecy wool
had been sheared off. Oh! how the sheep shivered
in the cold.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, what is the matter with you?” asked
Uncle Wiggily, kindly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am c-c-c-c-cold,” said the sheep, shiveringly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What makes you cold?” the bunny uncle
wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because they cut off so much of my wool.
You know how it is with me, for I am in the
Mother Goose book. Listen!</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Baa-baa, black sheep, have you any wool?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Yes, sir; yes, sir; three bags full.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>One for the master, one for the man,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And one for the little boy who lives in the lane.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“That’s the way I answered when they asked
me if I had any wool,” said Baa-baa.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And what did they do?” asked the bunny
uncle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why they sheared off my fleece, three bags
of it. I didn’t mind them taking the first bag
full, for I had plenty and it was so warm I
thought Spring was coming. And it doesn’t
hurt to cut off my fleecy wool, any more than it
hurts to cut a boy’s hair. And after they took
the first bag full of wool for the master they took
a second bag for the man. I didn’t mind that,
either. But when they took the third——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then they really did take three?” asked
Uncle Wiggily, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, to be sure. Why it’s that way in
the book of Mother Goose, you know, and they
had to do just as the book says.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I suppose so,” agreed Uncle Wiggily, sadly
like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, after they took the third bag of wool
off my back the weather grew colder, and I began
to shiver. Oh! how cold I was; and how
I shivered and shook. Of course if the master
and the man, and the little boy who lives in the
lane, had known I was going to shiver so, they
would not have taken the last bag of wool.
Especially the little boy, as he is very kind to
me.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But now it is done, and it will be a long
while before my wool grows out again. And as
long as it is cold weather I will shiver, I suppose,”
said Baa-baa, the black sheep.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, you shall not shiver!” cried Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How can you stop me?” asked the black
sheep.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By wrapping my old fur coat around you,”
said the rabbit gentleman. “I have two fur
overcoats, a new one and an old one. I am wearing
the new one. The old one is at my hollow-stump
bungalow. You go there and tell Nurse
Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy to give it to you. Tell her I
said so. Or you can go there and wait for me,
as I am going to get Dr. Possum to fix the thumb
of Little Jack Horner, who sat in a corner, eating
a Christmas pie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are very kind,” said Baa-baa. “I’ll go
to your bungalow and wait there for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he did, shaking and shivering all the way,
but he soon became warm when he sat by Nurse
Jane’s fire. And when Uncle Wiggily came
back from having sent Dr. Possum to Little Jack
Horner, the rabbit gentleman wrapped his old
fur coat around Baa-baa, the black sheep, who
was soon as warm as toast.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Baa-baa wore Uncle Wiggily’s old fur
coat until warm weather came, when the sheep’s
wool grew out long again. So everything was
all right, you see.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now, having learned the lesson that if
you cut your hair too short you may have to wear
a fur cap to stop yourself from getting cold, we
will wait for the next story, which, if the pencil
box doesn’t jump into the ink well and get a pail
of glue to make the lollypop stick fast to the
roller-skates, will be about Uncle Wiggily and
Polly Flinders.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='Ch-XXIV' class='c013'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND POLLY FLINDERS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>There</span>!” cried Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy,
the muskrat lady housekeeper, who took care of
the hollow-stump bungalow for Uncle Wiggily
Longears, the rabbit gentleman. “There, it is
all finished at last!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s all finished?” asked the bunny
uncle, who was reading the paper in his easy
chair near the fire, for the weather was still cold.
“I hope you don’t mean you have finished living
with me, Nurse Jane? For I would be very
lonesome if you were to go away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, don’t worry, I’ll not leave you, Wiggy,”
she said. “What I meant was that I had finished
making the new dress for Susie Littletail,
the rabbit girl.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good!” cried the bunny uncle. “A new
dress for my little niece Susie. That’s fine! If
you like, Nurse Jane, I’ll take it to her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish you would,” spoke the muskrat lady.
“I have not time myself. Just be careful of it.
Don’t let the bad fox or the skillery-scalery alligator
with humps on his ears bite holes in it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I won’t,” promised Uncle Wiggily. So
taking the dress, which Nurse Jane had sewed
for Susie, over his paw, and with his tall silk
hat over his ears, and carrying his red, white
and blue-striped barber-pole rheumatism crutch,
off Uncle Wiggily started for the Littletail
home.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Susie will surely like her dress,” thought the
rabbit gentleman. “It has such pretty colors.”
For it had, being pink and blue and red and yellow
and purple and lavender and strawberry
and lemon and Orange Mountain colors. There
may have been other colors in it, but I can think
of no more right away.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily was going along past Old
Mother Hubbard’s house, and past the place
where Mother Goose lived, when, coming to a
place near a big tree, Uncle Wiggily saw another
house. And from inside the house came
a crying sound.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! Oh, dear! What shall I do?”
sobbed a voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, ha! More trouble!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“I seem to be finding lots of people in
trouble lately. Well, now to see who this is!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Going up to the house, and peering in a window,
Uncle Wiggily saw a little girl sitting before
a fireplace. And this little girl was crying.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hello!” called Uncle Wiggily, in his jolly
voice, as he opened the window. “What is the
matter? Are you Little Bo Peep, and are you
crying because you have lost your sheep?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Uncle Wiggily,” answered the little
girl. “I am crying because I have spoiled my
nice new dress, and when my mother comes
home and finds it out she will whip me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no!” cried the bunny uncle. “Your
mother will never do that. But who are you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, don’t you know? I am little Polly
Flinders, I sat among the cinders, warming my
pretty little toes. ‘And her mother came and
caught her, and she whipped her little daughter,
for spoiling her nice new clothes.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s what it says in the Mother Goose
book,” said Polly Flinders, “and, of course,
that’s what will happen to me. Oh, dear! I
don’t want to be whipped. And I didn’t really
spoil quite all my nice new clothes. It’s only my
dress, and some hot ashes got on that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, that isn’t so bad,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“It may be that I can clean it for you.”
But when he looked at Polly’s dress he saw that
it could not be fixed, for, like Pussy Cat Mole’s
best petticoat, Polly’s dress had been burned
through with hot coals, so that it was full of
holes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, that can’t be fixed, I’m sorry to say,”
said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” sobbed Polly Flinders, as she
sat among the cinders. “What shall I do? I
don’t want to be whipped by my mother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you shall not be,” said the bunny uncle.
“Not that I think she would whip you, but we
will not give her a chance. See here, I have a
new dress that I was taking to Susie Littletail.
Nurse Jane can easily make my little rabbit niece
another.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So you take this one, and give me your old
one. And when your mother comes she will
not see the holes in your dress. Only you must
tell her what happened, or it would not be fair.
Always tell mothers and fathers everything that
happens to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will,” promised Polly Flinders.</p>

<p class='c011'>She soon took off her old dress and put on the
new one intended for Susie, and it just fitted her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, how lovely!” cried Polly Flinders,
looking at her toes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now,” said Uncle Wiggily, “you must
sit no more among the cinders.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll not,” Polly promised, and she went and
sat down in front of the looking-glass, where
she could look proudly at the new dress—not
too proudly, you understand, but just proud
enough.</p>

<p class='c011'>Polly thanked Uncle Wiggily, who took the
old soiled and burned dress to Susie’s house.
When the rabbit girl saw the bunny uncle coming
she ran to meet him, crying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! did Nurse Jane send you with my new
dress?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She did,” answered Uncle Wiggily, “but
see what happened to it on the way,” and he
showed Susie the burned holes and all.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” cried the little rabbit girl, sadly.
“Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind,” spoke Uncle Wiggily, kindly,
and he told all that had happened. It was a sort
of adventure, you see.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’m glad you gave Polly my dress!”
said Susie, clapping her paws.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nurse Jane shall make you another dress,”
promised Uncle Wiggily, and the muskrat lady
did. And when the mother of Polly Flinders
came home she thought the new dress was just
fine, and she did not whip her little daughter.
In fact, she said she would not have done so
anyhow. So that part of the Mother Goose book
is wrong.</p>

<p class='c011'>And thus everything came out all right, and
if the shaving brush doesn’t whitewash the
blackboard, so the chalk can’t dance on it with
the pencil sharpener, I’ll tell you next about
Uncle Wiggily and the garden maid.</p>

  <h2 id='Ch-XXV' class='c013'>CHAPTER XXV<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE GARDEN MAID</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Hey</span>, ho, hum!” exclaimed Uncle Wiggily
Longears, the rabbit gentleman, as he stretched
up his twinkling, pink nose, and reached his
paws around his back to scratch an itchy place.
“Ho, hum! I wonder what will happen to me
to-day?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you going out again?” asked Nurse
Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper.
“It seems to me that you go out a great
deal, Mr. Longears.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, yes; perhaps I do,” admitted the
bunny uncle. “But more things happen to me
when I go out than when I stay in the house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And do you like to have things happen to
you?” asked Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When they are adventures I do,” answered
the rabbit gentleman. “So here I go off for an
adventure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Off started the nice, old, bunny uncle, carrying
his red, white and blue-striped barber-pole
rheumatism crutch—over his shoulder this time.
For his pain did not hurt him much, as the sun
was shining, so he did not have to limp on the
crutch, which Nurse Jane had gnawed for him
out of a corn-stalk.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily had not gone very far toward
the fields and woods before he heard Nurse Jane
calling to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Wiggy! Wiggy, I say! Wait a moment!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, what is it?” asked the rabbit gentleman,
turning around and looking over his
shoulder. “Have I forgotten anything?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, it was I who forgot,” said the muskrat
lady housekeeper. “I forgot to tell you to bring
me a bottle of perfume. Mine is all gone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, I’ll bring you some,” promised
Mr. Longears. “It will give me something to
do—to go to the perfume store. Perhaps an adventure
may happen to me there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Once more he was on his way, and soon he
reached the perfume store, kept by a nice buzzing
bee lady, who gathered sweet smelling perfume,
as well as honey, from the flowers in Summer
and put it carefully away for the Winter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some perfume for Nurse Jane, eh?” said
the bee lady, as the rabbit gentleman knocked
on her hollow-tree house. “There you are,
Uncle Wiggily,” and she gave him a bottle of
the nice scent made from a number of flowers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My! That smells lovely!” exclaimed Uncle
Wiggily, as he pulled out the cork, and took a
long sniff. “Nurse Jane will surely like that
perfume!”</p>

<p class='c011'>With the sweet scented bottle in his paw, the
rabbit gentleman started back toward his hollow-stump
bungalow. He had not gone very
far before he saw a nurse maid, out in the garden,
back of a big house. There was a basket
in front of the maid, with some clothes in it, and
stretched across the garden was a line, with more
clothes on it, flapping in the wind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha!” exclaimed Uncle Wiggily. “I wonder
if that garden maid, hanging up the clothes,
wouldn’t like to smell Nurse Jane’s perfume?
Nurse Jane will not mind, and perhaps it will be
doing that maid a kindness to let her smell something
sweet, after she has been smelling washing-soap-suds
all morning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the bunny uncle, who was always doing
kind things, hopped over to the garden maid,
and politely asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wouldn’t you like to smell this perfume?”
and he held out the bottle he had bought of the
bee lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>The garden maid turned around, and said in
a sad voice:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, Uncle Wiggily. It is very kind
of you, I’m sure, and I would like to smell your
perfume. But I can’t.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why not?” asked the bunny uncle. “The
cork is out of the bottle. See!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That may very well be,” went on the garden
maid, “but the truth of the matter is that I cannot
smell, because a blackbird has nipped off
my nose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily, in great surprise, looked, and,
surely enough, a blackbird had nipped off the
nose of the garden maid.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bless my whiskers!” cried the bunny uncle.
“What a thing for a blackbird to do—nip off
your nose! Why did he do such an impolite
thing as that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, he had to do it, because it’s that way
in the Mother Goose book,” said the maid.
“Don’t you remember? It goes this way:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘The King was in the parlor,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Counting out his money,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Queen was in the kitchen,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Eating bread and honey.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The maid was in the garden,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Hanging out the clothes,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Along came a blackbird</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And nipped off her nose.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“That’s the way it was,” said the garden
maid.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, I remember now,” spoke Uncle
Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’m the maid who was in the garden,
hanging out the clothes,” said she, “and, as
you can see, along came a blackbird and nipped
off my nose. That is, you can’t see the blackbird,
but you can see the place where my nose
ought to be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” answered Uncle Wiggily, “I can.
It’s too bad. That blackbird ought to have his
feathers ruffled.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, he didn’t mean to be bad,” said the garden
maid. “He had to do as it says in the book,
and he had to nip off my nose. So that’s why I
can’t smell Nurse Jane’s nice perfume.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily thought for a minute. Then
he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just you wait here. I think I can fix it so
you can smell as well as ever.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the bunny uncle hurried off through the
woods until he found Jimmie Caw-Caw, the big
black crow boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jimmie,” said the bunny uncle, “will you
fly off, find the blackbird, and ask him to give
back the garden maid’s nose so she can smell
perfume?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will,” said Jimmie Caw-Caw, very politely.
“I certainly will!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Away he flew, and, after a while, in the deep,
dark part of the woods he found the blackbird,
sitting on a tree.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please give me back the garden maid’s
nose,” said Jimmie, politely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly,” answered the blackbird, also politely.
“I only took it off in fun. Here it is
back. I’m sorry I bothered the garden maid, but
I had to, as it’s that way in the Mother Goose
book.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Off to Uncle Wiggily flew Jimmie, the crow
boy, with the young lady’s nose, and soon Dr.
Possum had fastened it back on the garden
maid’s face as good as ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now you can smell the perfume,” said
Uncle Wiggily, and when he held up the bottle
the maid said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, what a lovely smell!”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the bunny uncle left a little perfume in a
bottle for the garden maid, and then she went
on hanging up the clothes, and she felt very
happy because she had a nose. So you see how
kind Uncle Wiggily and Jimmie were, and
Nurse Jane, too, liked the perfume very much.</p>

<p class='c011'>So if the little girl’s roller-skates don’t run
over the pussy’s tail and ruffle it all up so she
can’t go to the moving picture party, I’ll tell
you next of Uncle Wiggily and the King.</p>

  <h2 id='Ch-XXVI' class='c013'>CHAPTER XXVI<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE KING</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily Longears</span>, the nice old rabbit
gentleman, was sitting in an easy chair in his
hollow-stump bungalow, one day, looking out
of the window at the blue sky, and he was feeling
quite happy. And why should he not be happy?</p>

<p class='c011'>Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, his muskrat lady
housekeeper, had just given him a nice breakfast
of cabbage pancakes, with carrot maple
sugar tied in a bow-knot in the middle, and
Uncle Wiggily had eaten nine. Nine cakes, I
mean, not nine bows.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now,” said the bunny uncle to himself,
“I think I shall go out and take a walk. Perhaps
I may have an adventure. Do you want
any perfume, or anything like that from the
store?” asked Mr. Longears of Miss Fuzzy
Wuzzy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, thank you, I think not,” answered the
muskrat lady. “Just bring yourself home, and
that will be all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’ll do that all right,” promised the
bunny gentleman. So away he hopped, over the
fields and through the woods, humming to himself
a little song which went something like this:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I’m feeling happy now and gay,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Why shouldn’t I, this lovely day?</div>
      <div class='line in1'>’Tis time enough to be quite sad,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>When wind and rain make weather bad.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But, even then, one ought to try</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To think that soon it will be dry.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>So then, no matter what the weather,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Smile, as though tickled by a feather.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Uncle Wiggily felt happier than ever when
he had sung this song, but, as he went along a
little further, he came, all at once, to a very nice
house indeed, out of which floated the sound of
a sad voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily was surprised to hear this, for
the house was such a nice one that it seemed no
one ought to be unhappy who lived there.</p>

<p class='c011'>The house was made of gold and silver, with
diamond windows, and the chimney was made
of a red ruby stone, which, as every one knows,
is very expensive. But with all that the sad
voice came sailing out of one of the opened diamond
windows, and the voice said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! It’s gone! I can’t find it! I
dropped it and it rolled down a crack in the
floor. Now I’ll never get it again. Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, that sounds like some one in trouble,”
said the bunny uncle. “I must see if I cannot
help them,” for Uncle Wiggily helped real folk,
who lived in fine houses, as well as woodland
animals, who lived in hollow trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily hopped up to the open diamond
window of the gold and silver house, with
the red ruby chimney, and, poking his nose inside,
the rabbit gentleman asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is there some one here in trouble whom I
may have the pleasure of helping?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” answered a voice. “I’m here, and
I’m surely in trouble.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who are you, and what is the trouble, if I
may ask?” politely went on Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am the king,” was the answer. “This is
my palace, but, with all that, I am in trouble.
Come in.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In hopped Uncle Wiggily, and there, surely
enough, was the king, but he was in the kitchen,
down on his hands and knees, looking with one
eye through a crack in the floor, which is something
kings hardly ever do.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s down there,” he said. “And I can’t get
it. I’m too fat to go through the crack.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s down there?” Uncle Wiggily
wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My money,” answered the king. “You
may have heard about me,” and he recited this
little verse:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The king was in the kitchen,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Counting out his money;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The queen was in the parlor,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Eating bread and honey;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The maid was in the garden,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Hanging out the clothes,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Along came a blackbird,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Who nipped off her nose.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The fat man got up off the kitchen floor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m the king,” he said, taking up his gold
and diamond crown from a kitchen chair, where
he had put it as he kneeled down, so it would not
fall off and be dented. “From Mother Goose,
you know; don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I know,” answered Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I dare say you’ll find the queen in the parlor
eating bread and honey,” went on the king.
“At least I saw her start for there with a plate,
knife and fork as I was coming here. And, no
doubt, the maid is in the garden, where she’ll
pretty soon have her nose nipped off by a blackbird.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That part happened yesterday,” said Uncle
Wiggily. “I was there just after it happened,
and I got Jimmie Caw-Caw, the crow boy, to
fly after the blackbird and bring back the maid’s
nose. She is as well as ever now and can smell
all kinds of perfume.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good!” cried the fat king. “You were
very kind to help her. I only wish you could
help me. But I don’t see how you can. My
money, which I was counting, fell out of my
hands and dropped down a crack in the floor. I
can see it lying down there in the dirt, but I can’t
get at it unless I move to one side my gold and
silver palace, and I don’t want to do that. I
don’t suppose you can move a palace, can you?”
And he looked askingly at Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I can’t do that,” said the bunny uncle.
“But still I think I can get your money without
moving the palace.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How?” asked the king.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, I can go outside,” said Mr. Longears,
“and with my strong paws, which are just made
for digging, I can burrow, or dig, a place
through the dirt under your palace-house, crawl
in and get what you dropped.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, please do!” cried the king.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Uncle Wiggily did.</p>

<p class='c011'>Down under the cellar wall of the palace,
through the dirt, dug the bunny gentleman, with
his strong paws. Pretty soon he was right under
the kitchen, and there, just where they had
dropped through the crack, were the king’s gold
and silver pennies and other pieces of money.
Uncle Wiggily picked them up, put them in his
pocket and crawled out again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There you are, king,” he said. “You have
your money back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, thank you ever so much!” cried the
king. “I’ll have the cook give you some carrots.”
And he did, before he went on counting
his money in the kitchen. And this time he
stuffed a dish-rag in the crack so no more pennies
would fall through.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus we see how Uncle Wiggily helped the
king, and in the next chapter, if the condensed
milk doesn’t jump out of the can and scare the
coffee-pot so it drinks tea, I’ll tell you of Uncle
Wiggily and the queen.</p>

<p class='c011'>But that story will have to go in the second
part of this book, together with some others, for
now we are just halfway through, just as when
you cut an orange into two parts.</p>

<p class='c011'>So, if you are all ready, you may turn the page
and get ready for what comes next.</p>

</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily Longears</span>, the rabbit gentleman,
was hopping along through the woods one
day, limping a little on his red, white and blue
striped barber-pole rheumatism crutch, for he
had some pain, and he was wondering if any adventures
would happen to him when, all of a
sudden, there came a big puff of wind, and blew
off his tall silk hat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My goodness me sakes alive, and some rice
pudding!” cried the bunny uncle, giving a hop,
skip and a jump after his hat. “I had forgotten
that this is the first of March, when the wind
begins to blow Winter away and blow Spring
in its place. No wonder my hat went off!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He raced after his hat, which was bounding
along through the woods, rolling over and over
like a boy’s hoop on the sidewalk. At last Uncle
Wiggily caught his hat, but, as he was putting
it down hard over his ears, along came another
puff of wind, and this time blew away his red,
white and blue-striped crutch.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” cried the bunny uncle. “What
a lot of trouble I’m having to-day! I don’t believe
any one has as much trouble as I.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily hopped after his crutch, and
caught it just as it was about ready to be blown
into a bramble briar bush.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s a good thing it didn’t go in there,” he
said, “or I’d have been all scratched up getting
it out. Oh, dear! I wonder if I am going to
have any more trouble! No one has as much
as I.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes they have,” said a little voice in the
bramble briar bush. “Yes, they have! I’m in
trouble right now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who are you and what is the trouble?”
asked the bunny uncle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am the bee lady who keeps the honey and
perfume store,” was the answer. “I was on my
way to take some perfume to Mrs. Wibblewobble,
the duck lady, and when I tried to fly
through this bramble briar bush my wings were
caught, and I can’t get out. Isn’t that trouble
enough?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It certainly is,” answered Uncle Wiggily.
“I am sorry you are in trouble, for I know what
it means. But I will help you out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he did, very gently loosening the stickery
thorns of the bramble briar bushes from the bee
lady’s wings.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, thank you,” she said. “Now, I can fly
on with the perfume for Mrs. Wibblewobble.
If ever I can help you, or any friends of yours,
I shall, Uncle Wiggily.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you,” answered the rabbit gentleman.
Then, having given the bunny uncle a
smell from the little bottle of perfume she carried,
the bee lady flew on.</p>

<p class='c011'>With his tall silk hat and crutch the rabbit
gentleman now again went on through the
woods, until once more he came to the gold and
silver palace-house, with diamond windows, and
a chimney made of a red ruby stone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! That’s where the king lives, who was
in the kitchen, counting out his money,” thought
Mr. Longears. “I helped him, and I wonder
if there is any one else in the palace who is in
need of my help?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then, from one of the open parlor diamond
windows, there came a voice saying
sadly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! It’s all gone! There isn’t a bit
left, and what I’m going to do, I don’t know.
Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That sounds like trouble,” said the bunny
uncle. “I’ll see what it is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He went closer to the window, and there, in
the parlor, he saw a beautiful lady, all dressed
in silk and satin and cloth-of-gold, with a
diamond crown on her head. In one hand
she had a plate, and in the other a knife and
fork.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the matter?” asked Uncle Wiggily,
politely. “What is gone—the cook? And do
you have to do the dishes yourself?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, thank you, the cook hasn’t gone,” said
the lady. “I am the queen, as you can see, and
I ought to be in the parlor, eating bread and
honey. I’m in the parlor right enough, as you
can tell by the piano being here. And I have
the bread, but there is no honey! There isn’t a
bit of honey in the palace for me to eat, so I
don’t see how I can make things come out right,
as they do in the Mother Goose book. Oh,
dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t worry,” said Uncle Wiggily, kindly.
“Perhaps I can mend matters for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t see how you can,” said the queen.
“You haven’t any honey in your pocket; have
you?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” answered the bunny uncle. “I guess
I would be all stuck up, like a piece of fly paper,
if I carried honey in my pocket.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then if you have no honey you can’t help
me,” said the queen, sadly. “You see the king
is in the kitchen, counting out his money. I am
in here, and I ought to be eating honey. And
the maid is in the garden, hanging out the
clothes——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know all about that, and all about her
nose,” said Uncle Wiggily, with a smile. “I
helped the king get back his money, I helped
the maid get back her nose, and now I am going
to help you get your honey.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, how good of you!” cried the queen,
who felt like hugging Uncle Wiggily, only
queens do not do such things, you know. “And
I really need the honey, for I am hungry. But
how can you get it?” the queen asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll show you,” answered the rabbit gentleman.
Then, going to the open window, he
made a noise like a flower, and called:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Bee! Mrs. Bee! Will you do me a
favor now? You promised you would, and now
is your chance. Will you do me a favor?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I will,” answered a buzzing voice, and
along flew the bee lady, whom Uncle Wiggily
had helped out of the briar bush. “What is it
you wish?” she buzzed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some honey for the queen to eat in the parlor,”
spoke the bunny uncle. “She hasn’t any,
and she must have some to be like the story in
the Mother Goose book, or things will not come
out right. The queen needs honey.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She shall have some at once,” buzzed Mrs.
Bee. Away she flew and pretty soon she came
back with a lot of honey.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, thank you, and you, too, Uncle Wiggily,”
cried the queen, as she sat in the parlor
and ate the sweet stuff. “Now everything is all
right.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And so it was, Uncle Wiggily having made it
so. And if the clothes line doesn’t twist itself
in and out among the pickets of the fence like
a carpenter’s shaving and try to play hop-scotch
with the rose bush, I’ll tell you next about the
bunny gentleman and the ding-dong-bell pussy.</p>

  <h2 id='p2-Ch-II' class='c013'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND DING-DONG PUSSY</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Mother Goose</span>, the Old Woman Who Lived
in a Shoe and Old Mother Hubbard hurried one
day across the field and through the woods, to
the hollow-stump bungalow of Uncle Wiggily
Longears, the rabbit gentleman. Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper,
looking out of the hollow-stump window, saw
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My goodness, Uncle Wiggily!” cried
Nurse Jane. “Oh! Look who’s coming this
way. Company! Oh, my! And my shoes not
buttoned! Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The bunny uncle stepped to the window beside
the muskrat lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They’re coming here,” said Mr. Longears.
“Mother Goose, Mrs. Hubbard and the Shoe
Lady. You aren’t giving a surprise party, are
you, Nurse Jane, that they are coming to?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, indeed,” answered Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy.
“Though to see the three of them coming this
way is a surprise to me. Something must be the
matter. See how worried they look.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Trouble, I suppose,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“Well, if they are in trouble it will give me
pleasure to help them out. Open the door,
Nurse Jane.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, they can’t get in here,” said Miss
Fuzzy Wuzzy. “Our little hollow-stump bungalow
is too small for Mother Hubbard, Mother
Goose and the Shoe Lady, or even one of them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So it is,” agreed Uncle Wiggily. “I’ll have
to go outside to talk to them,” and he did, politely
hopping through the hollow-stump window.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” cried Old Mother
Hubbard. “Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Such trouble!” exclaimed the Old Woman
Who Lived in a Shoe, but who I shall call the
Shoe Lady, for short, “Oh, such trouble!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s Pussy!” said Mother Goose. “She’s
gone!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gone?” asked Uncle Wiggily. “Gone?
Who is Pussy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, you know,” said Mother Goose.
“Pussy is a cousin to Fuzzo, Wuzzo and
Muzzo, the three little kittens, who lost their
mittens.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, to be sure,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“I remember! So Pussy has gone; has she?
What happened to her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s what we don’t know, and what we
came to you to have you find out,” said Mother
Goose. “You see, Pussy—that’s her first name,
her last one is Mew—Pussy Mew came on a
little visit to Mrs. Purr, who is her aunt, and the
mother of the three little kittens who lost their
mittens.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, I remember!” said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Pussy is lost,” spoke the Shoe Lady.
“She went out to the store for Mrs. Purr while
Fuzzo, Wuzzo and Muzzo were taking their
tail-chasing lesson, and Pussy did not come
back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What did she go to the store after?” Uncle
Wiggily wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A yeast cake,” answered Mother Hubbard.
“But the yeast cake didn’t come back, either.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not having any legs, I don’t see how it
could,” said Uncle Wiggily. “But what is it
you want me to do, ladies?” he asked, making
a polite bow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Find Pussy Mew,” said Mother Goose.
“You were so clever at helping the king and
queen and the maid in the garden hanging out
the clothes, when along came a blackbird that
nipped off her nose, that I’m sure you can find
Pussy for us. We’re really worried about her.
Please find her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll try,” promised Uncle Wiggily. So in a
little while off he started, limping along on his
red, white and blue tall silk hat, with his barber-pole
rheumatism crutch on his head. Oh, no!
excuse me, if you please—I mean he had his
crutch under his paw and his hat on his head.</p>

<p class='c011'>Over the fields and through the woods went
Uncle Wiggily until, pretty soon, he came to
the hollow-stump school where the lady mouse
taught the animal children their lessons. The
bell was ringing, for it was time for the children
to run out to play at recess.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! I wonder if Pussy Mew could have
gone to school, forgetting to come home with
the yeast cake,” said Uncle Wiggily. “I’ll inquire.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He asked the lady mouse teacher, but she said
that Pussy was not in school, so Uncle Wiggily
hurried on, looking all through the woods and
over the fields. But no Pussy did he find until,
all at once, as he came near a well, he felt thirsty
for a drink of water.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, how I wish I had a drink!” cried Uncle
Wiggily. “I wonder if I could get one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He went to the edge of the well, but it was an
old one, and there was no rope or bucket by
which water could be pulled up. Then the old
rabbit gentleman saw something shining
brightly down at the bottom of the well, and he
called out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is any one down there who could give me
a drink of water?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I am down here,” was the answer, “but
I cannot give you a drink of water for I cannot
get up myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who are you?” asked Uncle Wiggily, surprised
like.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then the school bell rang again, and a
voice said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ding-dong bell, Pussy’s in the well.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Who put her in? Little Johnnie Green.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Who pulled her out? Big Johnnie Stout.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“Only that last part isn’t right,” the voice
went on, “for Big Johnnie Stout hasn’t come to
pull me out. But I’m in the well, as you can
tell by the ding-dong bell. Oh, dear! I don’t
know what to do. I want so much to get out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll help you out, Pussy,” said Uncle Wiggily,
kindly. “I have been looking all over
for you. But if you are in the well how is it that
you did not sink to the bottom?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because I have with me a yeast cake that I
went to the store to get,” was the answer. “The
yeast cake makes bread light, so it will rise, and
it made me light, so I could rise to the top of
the water.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “It was the
shiny tinfoil of the yeast cake I saw at the bottom
of the well. I’ll soon have you out now,
Pussy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He gave a jump over to a wild grape vine,
gnawed off a piece with his strong teeth, and
then, using the grape vine as a rope, he lowered
it down into the well. Pussy took hold of it with
her claws and paws, putting the yeast cake in
one ear, and Uncle Wiggily easily pulled her
out. She was wet, but not hurt at all.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, thank you, Uncle Wiggily,” Pussy
Mew said. “So it was you, and not Johnnie
Stout, who pulled me out?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of that there is no doubt,” laughed Uncle
Wiggily. “But did Johnnie Green push you
in?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I stumbled and fell in,” answered Pussy.
“Everything about me in the Mother Goose
story is wrong except the part like ‘ding-dong
bell, Pussy’s in the well.’ I really was in.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Pussy hurried on to her aunt’s house
with the yeast cake, and all was well. And
Mother Goose was very thankful to Uncle Wiggily
for having helped the little cat, who, ever
after that was called the “ding-dong-bell pussy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So in the next chapter, if the piano music
doesn’t go to sleep in the bread box, where the
phonograph can’t find it to play with, I’ll tell
you about Uncle Wiggily and the Shoe Lady.</p>

  <h2 id='p2-Ch-III' class='c013'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE SHOE LADY</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Where</span> are you going, Uncle Wiggily?”
asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat
lady, who kept house for Mr. Longears, the rabbit
gentleman. “Where are you going this fine
day?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To the store,” answered the bunny uncle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To the store? Why, I don’t want anything,”
spoke Nurse Jane. “You are always so kind,
going to the store whenever I need anything, but
nothing is needed for the hollow-stump bungalow
to-day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am going to the store for myself,” Uncle
Wiggily said. “I am going to buy a new pair
of shoes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So off he hopped, leaning on his red, white
and blue-striped barber-pole rheumatism crutch,
over the fields and through the woods until he
came to the shoe store.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A pair of shoes? Certainly,” said the
monkey-doodle gentleman who kept the store.
“Will you have high shoes or low shoes?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, as it is near Spring I’ll get low shoes,”
Uncle Wiggily said. “They will be cooler if
I should happen to go down to the Asbury Park
ocean board walk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ties, we call them, instead of low shoes, but
it is all the same,” went on the monkey-doodle.
“Here you are.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He brought out a pair of low shoes, or ties,
but, when Uncle Wiggily tried to get them on,
his feet would not go into them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I see—too tight,” said the monkey-doodle.
“I will put a little talcum powder in the shoes
and your foot will then easily slip in.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But, even with the talcum powder, Uncle
Wiggily’s paws would not slip in.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must use a shoe-horn,” said the monkey.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is a shoe-horn something to play on?”
asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, it is something to make a shoe slip on
easily,” said the monkey-doodle. He brought
out a smooth, shiny piece of tin, like a big tablespoon
without a handle. Holding this against
his heel, Uncle Wiggily could easily slip his foot
into his new shoe. Soon he had them both on,
and they fitted him well.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are they too tight?” asked the monkey-doodle,
as the bunny gentleman stepped around
the store, practicing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, they’re just right,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“They go on a bit hard, but once I have put
them on with the shoe-where the shoe-horn they are very nice.
I’ll take them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you may have some talcum powder and
the shoe-horn to take with you, to put your shoes
on easily whenever you wish,” said the monkey.
For you know Uncle Wiggily pulled the shoe-horn
out of his shoe, once he had his foot in.
They couldn’t both be there at the same time,
you see.</p>

<p class='c011'>Away hopped the rabbit gentleman in his new
shoes and with the shoe-horn and the slippery-sliding
talcum powder in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, now I have my new shoes I wonder
if I will meet with an adventure to-day?”
thought Uncle Wiggily, as he hopped on. And
he did. I’ll tell you about it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pretty soon he came to a great, big shoe, standing
in the middle of the woods. The shoe had
a roof over it, with a chimney sticking out of
the top. There was a door to the shoe, and windows.
In fact, it was a house, made out of a
great, big shoe which a giant used to wear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! This is where the Old Woman lives,”
said Uncle Wiggily. “The Shoe Lady. I wonder
if she is at home?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was going to knock on the door and ask
how all the children were, when, from inside
the shoe there came the sound of crying; children
crying; many of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! I wonder if that means trouble?”
asked Uncle Wiggily of himself. “I had better
see if I can do anything to help.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He knocked on the door, and the Old Woman
Who Lived in a Shoe, or Shoe Lady, as I call her
for short, opened it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is anything the matter?” asked Uncle Wiggily.
“I heard crying.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course,” spoke the Shoe Lady, “the children
always cry when I whip them. Don’t you
know how it is in the Mother Goose book:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘There was an old woman</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Who lived in a shoe,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She had so many children</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She didn’t know what to do.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She gave them some broth,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Without any bread;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She whipped them all soundly</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And sent them to bed.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“That’s what happened,” said the Shoe Lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, er—excuse me—but, that is, do you
think it just right to whip them ALL?” asked
Uncle Wiggily, kindly. “Might not at least
<i>one</i> of them have been good?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, bless your tall hat!” exclaimed the Shoe
Lady, with a laugh. “I don’t <i>really</i> whip them,
you know. That part of the verse is wrong. I
only make believe to whip them—pretend, you
know, so as to make it as near like the book as
I can.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I heard crying,” said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but it was only make-believe crying,
just like the pretended whipping,” laughed the
Shoe Lady. “I wouldn’t for the world hurt one
of the children, even though I have so many I
don’t know what to do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily was glad to hear that, and he
was just hopping on, when up came running a
little boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, take me in! Take me in!” he cried.
“I want my make-believe whipping. I want
to make-believe cry, have my broth, without any
bread, and go to bed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Toodles!” exclaimed the Shoe Lady,
looking at him in surprise. “I did not know
you were out. You stayed too late at your play.
There are so many children here now I don’t believe
there is room to get you in. After the children
eat their supper they swell up, and the shoe
house is hardly large enough for them,” she said
to Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I must get in,” cried Toodles. “I
must!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’ll try,” said the Shoe Lady. She and
Uncle Wiggily tried, but the shoe was so full
of children that not another one could get in.
They pushed and pulled and shoved and hauled,
but poor Toodles could not get in.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! I don’t know what to do,” said
the lady, who lived in a shoe. “I guess Toodles
will have to sleep out in the woods to-night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No! Wait! I have it!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“When my foot would not go in my new
tight shoe the monkey put talcum powder in it
and used a shoe-horn. I’ll do that to Toodles.”
And so he did. And when the little boy was
sprinkled with sweet smelling talcum powder,
and when the shiny, slippery shoe-horn was
slipped into the top of the crowded shoe, in on
that slid Toodles as nicely as you please, and
everything was all right. There’s always room
for one more, even in a shoe, you know.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, Uncle Wiggily,” said the Shoe
Lady, and then she gave Toodles his make-believe
whipping, he made believe cry, he ate his
real broth and went to his real bed. And that’s
where you must go if it’s time.</p>

<p class='c011'>But if the butter doesn’t slide off the slice of
bread, and go coasting down the cake plate hill
with a bun that ought to be sitting beside the custard,
I’ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and
Jack-be-Nimble.</p>

</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily</span>! Uncle Wiggily!” called
Sammie Littletail, the little rabbit boy, one Saturday
morning, as he hopped up to the hollow-stump
bungalow, where the nice, old bunny
uncle lived. “Come on out and play, Uncle
Wiggily. Please do!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, hop away, Sammie!” called Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper,
looking out of the kitchen window. “Here,
take this cabbage jam tart and run away. Uncle
Wiggily can’t bother to play with you to-day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I haven’t any one else to play with,” said
Sammie. “Johnnie and Billie Bushytail, the
squirrels, are taking their nut-gnawing lesson,
and Peetie and Jackie Bow Wow, the puppies,
are taking their bone-gnawing lessons.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Haven’t you any lessons?” asked Nurse
Jane.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No. I’ve done mine. I had to practice
jumping a little. But there’s no school, as it’s
Saturday, and I do want some one to play with.
My sister Susie has gone off with Lulu and Alice
Wibblewobble, the ducks, and anyhow I don’t
want to play with girl animals. Won’t Uncle
Wiggily come out?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Sammie. Here, take this carrot cookie
and hop along,” said Nurse Jane.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wait a minute,” spoke another voice, and
Uncle Wiggily himself went out on the back
stoop. “What is it you want, Sammie?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He wants you to come out and play with
him!” cried Nurse Jane. “The idea!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’ll come,” said Uncle Wiggily, kindly.
“I haven’t much to do, and perhaps we may
have an adventure together. Come on, Sammie,
we’ll go off in the woods, and we’ll play.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the old gentleman rabbit and his little
bunny nephew hopped off in the woods together,
and soon were having a fine time, scurrying in
among the dried leaves, and hiding behind old
logs and stumps.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder if there is any new cabbage growing
around here?” said Sammie, after a bit.
“I’m hungry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is too soon for cabbage yet,” answered
Uncle Wiggily. “It will not be Spring for
several weeks. Nor are there any new carrots
to be had. But pretty soon we’ll pass a lollypop
store, and you may have a lettuce flavored
one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That will be nice—thank you,” said Sammie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you do your jumping lesson to-day?”
asked the old gentleman rabbit, after a bit.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said Sammie. “I practiced half an
hour.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me see how well you can jump,” spoke
the bunny uncle. “I used to be a pretty good
jumper when I was young.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Sammie jumped from one stump, far over
a log, to another.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fine!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “That’s better
than I can do, but I’ll try.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He did try, and, though he could not leap as
far as Sammie had done, Mr. Longears did very
well. If it had not been for his rheumatism he
could have done better.</p>

<p class='c011'>He and Sammie jumped about for some time,
and all at once they were surprised to hear a
voice saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! I wish I could jump as far as
that. But I don’t believe I shall ever be able to.
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! That sounds like trouble,” said Uncle
Wiggily. “Who are you and where are you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m Jack, and I’m behind this big stone,”
was the answer, and out stepped a boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! I thought at first it might be Jackie
Bow Wow,” spoke Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; I am another Jack,” said the boy. “I’m
one of Mother Goose’s friends.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you Jack Sprat?” Sammie wanted to
know, “who could eat no fat?”</p>

<p class='c011'>But still the boy did not look like that Jack.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll tell you who I am,” the boy said. “I’m
Jack-be-Nimble, Jack-be-Quick, Jack jump
over the candlestick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, now I remember,” spoke Uncle Wiggily.
“How do you do, Jack-be-Nimble?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But the trouble is I <i>can’t</i> do it,” went on
Jack.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can’t do what?” asked Sammie Littletail.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can’t be nimble and jump over the candlestick,”
was the answer. “I’ve tried and tried.
But it seems of no use. Every time I jump I
either hit the candle, and put it out, or I come
down ker-flunk! in it, and get my shoes all
grease. Mother Goose says I ought to be
ashamed of myself. If I can’t jump over the
candlestick, I can’t be in her book, she says, and
Oh, dear! I don’t want to be put out of the nice
book.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s too bad,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“Now, Jack, I’ll tell you what to do. You
watch Sammie and me jump, and perhaps that
will teach you how. Watch us. Come on,
Sammie, we must jump some more to teach
Jack.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the old rabbit gentleman and the little rabbit
boy jumped about on the soft, dried leaves
in the wood. Jack watched them, and then he
tried. Of course, having only two legs, he could
not leap as far as could the rabbits, with four.
But still Jack did very well.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, come here every day to the woods,”
said Uncle Wiggily, “and we will give you a
jumping lesson. Don’t say anything to Mother
Goose about it, and you will soon give her a nice
surprise by jumping over the candlestick easily
some day. I once took dancing lessons from a
waltzing mouse lady without saying anything to
Nurse Jane about it, and my! how surprised she
was when I did the fox trot.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll come,” promised Jack-be-Nimble. And
he did. Every day for a week, he took jumping
lessons secretly in the woods, of Uncle Wiggily
and Sammie, until finally Jack was a very good
jumper, indeed. Then one day Old Mother
Goose said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Jack, I fear it is of no use. You can’t
jump over the candlestick, as you ought to do
to be in my book, so you’ll have to go out. I’ll
get the cow, who leaped over the moon, to jump
for me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, please give me one more chance!”
begged Jack. “Please!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mother Goose kindly did so, and lo! and behold!
when next he tried, Jack-be-Nimble
jumped over the candlestick as easily as anything.
Away over it he jumped and came down
on the other side.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Jack! Where did you learn to jump
so well?” asked Mother Goose, in great surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Uncle Wiggily and Sammie taught me,” he
answered. And ever after that nimble Jack had
no trouble.</p>

<p class='c011'>And if the apple pie doesn’t go out skating
with the jam tart, and forget to come in to supper,
I’ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and
Tommie Tinker’s dog.</p>

  <h2 id='p2-Ch-V' class='c013'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND TOMMIE TINKER’S DOG</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily</span>, here’s a letter for you,”
called Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat
lady housekeeper, to the rabbit gentleman, one
morning, as he sat in the easy chair in his hollow-stump
bungalow. “The postman bird just left
it as he flew past.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A letter for me!” exclaimed the bunny
uncle, as he opened and read it. “That’s nice.
It’s from Grandfather Goosey Gander. He
wants me to come over and play checkers with
him. He’s so lonesome.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you can’t go!” cried Nurse Jane, tying
her tail up in a knot, for she was going to sweep
and dust, and she did not want to step on herself.
“You can’t go, because you said your
rheumatism hurt you so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I guess I can manage to get over to see
Grandpa by limping on the nice red, white and
blue-striped rheumatism crutch, which you so
kindly gnawed for me out of a corn-stalk,” spoke
Uncle Wiggily. “I’ll try, anyhow, for I haven’t
seen Grandpa Goosey in nearly a week. I dare
say I can get over there all right. It’s a nice
day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I wish you wouldn’t go,” said Nurse
Jane, slowly, making her whiskers dance up and
down. “I’m sure something will happen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, nonsensicalness!” laughed Uncle Wiggily,
as he went out of the bungalow. Over the
fields and through the woods he roamed, and he
had to rest several times on his crutch, for the
rheumatism hurt him more than he thought it
would.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I’ll get there all right,” he said. No
sooner had he spoken, however, than all at once
his crutch slid on a piece of slippery-elm bark,
and Uncle Wiggily fell down. He did not hurt
himself much, for he sat down on a pile of soft,
dried leaves. But when the bunny uncle arose,
and tried to walk on his crutch, he could not,
as it was cracked and splintered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I lean my weight on it the crutch will
break,” said Uncle Wiggily, sadly, “and I can’t
walk without leaning on it. Oh, dear! What
shall I do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, as he stood there in the woods, he heard
a voice calling:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Umbrellas to mend! Umbrellas to mend,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>If you’ve pans with holes in, for me you must send.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I’ll fix them up, quick as a wink—or a winker;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>For I am a pot, pan and umbrella tinker.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Uncle Wiggily looked off among the trees,
and, surely enough, along came a traveling
tinker, with a box over his shoulder and a little
fire in a tin pot in his hand. Beside him walked
a little boy who had a little dog.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, daddy! Look at the rabbit gentleman!”
cried the little boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I see him,” said the tinker. “He is Uncle
Wiggily Longears, if I am not mistaken. Are
you not?” he asked, politely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am,” answered the bunny uncle. “And I
am in great trouble. I have splintered and
cracked my crutch and I can’t limp along on it
to get to Grandpa Goosey’s house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I can easily fix that for you,” said the
kind tinker, and he did, fastening a strong piece
of tin around the broken part of Uncle Wiggily’s
crutch so it was as good as ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the rabbit gentleman thanked the nice
tinker man and hopped on, and the tinker and
his little boy, whose name was Tommie, and the
little boy’s dog, whose name was Bow-Wow-Wow,
went on their way, the tinker singing his
funny song.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily reached Grandpa Goosey’s
house all right, and he and the goose gentleman
had fun playing checkers. And when it was
time for Uncle Wiggily to hop back to his hollow-stump
bungalow Grandpa Goosey gave
him a fine, large bone, with nice meat on it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Give that to Mrs. Bow Wow for her little
puppy dog boys, Jackie and Peetie,” said the
goose gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will, thank you,” said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>The rabbit gentleman was hopping along
through the woods on his way home when, all
at once, he heard some one crying.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! That sounds like trouble,” he said.
“I was in trouble a little while ago about my
crutch and the tinker helped me. Now, I must
try to help some one in my turn. That’s only
fair.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily looked around the corner of
a stump and saw the tinker’s little boy, Tommie,
sitting on a log and crying very hard.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Tommie! What’s the matter?” asked
the bunny uncle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! Boo hoo!” cried Tommie. “My
nice dog is lost, and I can’t find him. And I
must have him, you know, or else I can’t be in
Mother Goose’s book. My dog and I belong
there, you see.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I see,” said Uncle Wiggily, kindly. “But
how did your dog get lost?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I was helping my father mend some umbrellas
for Old King Cole,” said Tommie, “and,
when we weren’t looking, my dog ran off in the
woods. I guess he must be lost there, for he
hasn’t come back. My father, Mr. Tinker, went
to look for him, and so did I, but I hurt my toe
and I can’t look any more; and—Oh, dear! Oh,
dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, there! Don’t cry any more,” said the
nice bunny uncle. “I’ll go look for your pet
dog for you. Just you wait here. Your father
was kind to me, so I want to be kind to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily went off through the woods,
looking here, there and everywhere and pretty
soon he heard behind a tree some one saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bow! Wow! Wow!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! Whose dog art thou?” asked Uncle
Wiggily, quickly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Little Tommie Tinker’s dog, Bow! Wow!
Wow!” came the answer, and out from under
a berry bush ran the lost dog, wagging his tail.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” he begged. “Can
you take me to Tommie? I’ve been looking
everywhere for him, and just now I smelled the
nice meat bone you carry and I ran out of the
bush to see who had it. Oh, I’m so glad I found
you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I’m glad, too,” said the bunny uncle.
“And Tommie will be glad when he sees you.
Come alone, doggie, I’ll take you to him. It’s
a good thing I had this bone, which you smelled,
or I might never have found you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Uncle Wiggily gave Little Tommie
Tinker’s dog some meat from Grandpa Goosey
Gander’s bone, and took the little dog to Tommie
and Mr. Tinker, who had come back without
having found Bow-Wow-Wow. You can
just imagine how glad every one was that everything
had come out all right, so Tommie could
stay in the Mother Goose book, and the little
dog was glad also.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Uncle Wiggily hopped along home,
Tommie Tinker went on his way, and in the
next chapter, if our automobile doesn’t run off
the sidewalk into a candy store, chasing after a
lollypop, I’ll tell you about Uncle Wiggily and
Mary’s little lamb.</p>

  <h2 id='p2-Ch-VI' class='c013'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND MARY’S LAMB</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>One</span> day Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the
muskrat lady, was looking around the hollow-stump
bungalow, behind pictures, under the
piano, in corners and everywhere.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the matter?” asked Uncle Wiggily
Longears, the rabbit gentleman, “have you lost
something, Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” Nurse Jane answered. “I was just
looking to see how much house-cleaning I must
do. It will soon be Spring, and the bungalow
must be made nice and clean, ready for Summer.
There is quite a lot of dust behind the pictures
and under the piano.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bungalow-cleaning!” said Uncle Wiggily,
sort of sad and solemn like. “I know what that
means. No meals on time. No place to sit
down, no place to hang your hat—nothing at
all. I suppose I had better be out of the way
when you turn my bungalow upside down to
clean it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I suppose you had,” agreed Nurse Jane.
“Still, there is no hurry. I won’t start cleaning
until to-morrow, or next day. But if you are
going out now you might bring me something
from the store.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What?” asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A scrubbing brush and a cake of soap,” answered
the muskrat lady. “I’ll need them to
clean the floors.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You shall have them,” promised Uncle Wiggily.
Then off he started with his tall silk hat
and his red, white and blue-striped barber-pole
rheumatism crutch that Nurse Jane had gnawed
for him out of a corn-stalk, and which Tommie
Tinker’s father had mended for him, as I told
you in the story before this one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder if I shall have any adventures to-day?”
thought the bunny uncle, as he hopped
and skipped along through the woods. “I
haven’t had one since I found Tommie Tinker’s
dog.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Mr. Longears reached the store without
anything having happened to him, and, buying
the cake of soap and the scrubbing brush, back
he started for his hollow-stump bungalow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nurse Jane said there was no hurry,” spoke
the rabbit gentleman to himself, “but I want to
get the house-cleaning over with as soon as I
can. So I’ll hurry back with the soap and
brush.”</p>

<p class='c011'>All of a sudden, and just as Mr. Longears
was wondering if he would have time to call on
Nannie and Billie Wagtail, the goat children,
he heard a rustling in the bushes, and a voice
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! However did it happen? Oh,
how too bad it is! You’re nothing at all like
Mother Goose’s book says you should be. Oh,
whatever am I to do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily looked around the corner of a
tree, and there he saw a little girl, and beside her
stood a little lamb, as black as a coal, or a barrel
of tar. I don’t know which is blacker.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! This looks like trouble,” whispered
Uncle Wiggily. Then: “That surely is Mary,”
he said, out loud.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I’m Mary,” spoke the little girl, “and
I know you. Jack Horner told me about
you, and how you helped him pull his thumb
out of his plum pie. I wish you could help
me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the matter?” asked Uncle Wiggily.
“I’ll help you if I can.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s him,” said Mary, pointing to the little
baby sheep. “You know how it goes in the
book:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Mary had a little lamb,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Its fleece was white as snow.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And everywhere that Mary went,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The lamb was sure to go.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“Yes, I know that,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“But this can’t be your lamb. Instead of being
white as snow, he’s black—as black as any
crow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s just the trouble!” said Mary, with
tears in her eyes. “Oh, Lambie! How did you
get your nice white coat so black?” she asked.
“You can’t follow me to school that way; you
know you can’t.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ba-aa! No, I suppose I can’t,” spoke the
lamb, sort of sad and lonesome like. “I didn’t
mean to do it, but I went past a place where
some men were cleaning out a chimney and the
black soot blew from it all over me. I’m as sorry
about it as you are.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is too bad,” said Uncle Wiggily. “But
nothing is so bad that it might not be worse.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“This will be worse before it is better,” said
Mary. “I suppose the only thing to do now is
to take my lamb to the barber’s, who shaves a
pig, and makes a wig. The barber can cut off
the top part of the lamb’s fleecy wool and get
down to the nice, white part. But if I do that
I’ll be late for school. And the lamb must follow
me there, you see, or it won’t be like the
book. Oh, Lambkin! why did you do it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I—I’m sorry,” said Mary’s little lamb.
“But, please, don’t have my wool cut off. It’s
too cold this weather. I’d shiver.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must,” said Mary. “To make you white
as snow, you know. I’ll have to have your wool
cut.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No! you won’t have to do that!” cried Uncle
Wiggily. “I know something better than that.
Soot is only black dirt. It will wash off with
soap and water. And, see here! I have some
soap for Nurse Jane’s bungalow-cleaning and
a scrubbing brush. Come on, Mary. We’ll
find some water and give the lamb’s coat a good
scrubbing with soap suds. We’ll see what that
will do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’m afraid we’ll never get him clean,”
sadly said Mary; “but it is very good of you to
think of it, Uncle Wiggily.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They found a nice little brook, and leading
the lamb to it, Uncle Wiggily rolled up his
sleeves and with the soap and scrubbing brush
began to wash the black soot out of the fleecy
wool of Mary’s little lamb.</p>

<p class='c011'>Away and away scrubbed the bunny uncle,
making a great suddsy lather. He rubbed it
well into the fluffy wool. Then, when the soap
suds were washed out, why, Mary’s lamb’s fleece
was as white as snow! just as it ought to be.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily!” cried Mary. “How
good you are! Now my little lamb can follow
me to school, no matter if it is against the rule.
Thank you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then away she ran, and the lamb followed
after her, and Uncle Wiggily, pleased that he
had done a kindness, took the rest of the soap
and the scrubbing brush to Nurse Jane.</p>

<p class='c011'>And if the man painting our house doesn’t put
red, green and purple stripes around it to make
it look like a moving picture going to the circus,
I’ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and Peter
Piper.</p>

  <h2 id='p2-Ch-VII' class='c013'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND PETER PIPER</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily Longears</span>, the rabbit gentleman,
was hopping along across a green field.
The field was not very green, but was just beginning
to show a little green grass and clover,
for, as yet, Spring had not fully arrived.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But still I may find a few green things growing
that I can eat or take to Sammie and Susie
Littletail, the bunny children,” thought Mr.
Longears. So on and on he hopped. The sun
was shining, it was not very cold, and Uncle
Wiggily felt happy because his rheumatism did
not pain him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And when Summer comes it will not hurt
me at all,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>The rabbit gentleman was wondering whether
or not he would have an adventure that day,
when, all at once, he saw, climbing over the
fence, a boy dressed in a green suit, wearing a
red cap and with blue shoes on his feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! He is a funny looking chap!” thought
the bunny uncle. “I think he must be one of
Mother Goose’s friends. I’ll ask him.” And he
did.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, how do you do, Uncle Wiggily?”
asked the queer boy. “Yes, indeed, I’m one of
the many children of Mother Goose, to whom
you have been so kind. I’m Peter Piper.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you any relation to Tom-Tom, the
Piper’s son?” asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I’m his cousin. But I had nothing to
do with taking the pig. Tom-Tom did that himself.
But, if you please, I have a riddle for you
to guess.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A riddle? Come, that’s good! I like riddles.
Tell it to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the queer boy stood up straight and recited
this:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Where is the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“Oh, my!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “That’s
a hard one. Let me see now. ‘If Peter Pepper
pipped a pick of peckled Pipers——!’”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no! You have it wrong,” said Peter,
smiling. “Try once more. Say it after me:
‘Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily tried again:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pickled Peter pipped a pep of Piperd
pikers——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear, no! Wrong again!” laughed
Peter. “Now, once more. Say the last part
first and perhaps it will come easier to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Uncle Wiggily said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is the pop of pickered Peters picker
Piper pepped?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I—I’m afraid you can’t say it,” said Peter,
gently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m afraid so myself,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“I shan’t try again. It makes my tongue all
twisted and hurts my funny bone. I give up.
What’s the answer? Where are the peppers?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here they are!” exclaimed Peter, and from
behind his back he held out a peck of pickled
peppers. “That’s the only kind you can pick
this time of year,” he went on. “I’m taking
them to Mrs. Wibblewobble, the duck lady.
She mixes them with corn-meal and fries them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll go with you,” spoke Uncle Wiggily. “I
haven’t seen Alice and Lulu and Jimmie
Wibblewobble in some time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the bunny uncle and Peter Piper picked
their way across the field toward the duck lady’s
house. More than once Uncle Wiggily tried to
say the riddle, but his tongue grew more and
more twisted until he was walking sideways instead
of frontwards. So he gave it up.</p>

<p class='c011'>He and Peter Piper had not gone very far before
Peter’s shoe lace came loose and he stooped
down behind a big stone to tie it—tie the lace, I
mean, not the stone. And while he was doing
this along came the bad old fox, who had not
bothered Uncle Wiggily in some time.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, ha!” cried the fox, showing his teeth.
“This is the time I have you, Mr. Longears! I
was just wondering what I would eat for dinner,
but now I know. It shall be you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Me?” asked Uncle Wiggily, curious like
and wondering.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, you. Get ready for dinner! My dinner!”
snarled the fox.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily thought quickly. He did not
want to be a dinner for the fox, so he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Before you eat would you not like to guess
a riddle?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said the fox, “I would. What is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And do you promise not to eat me until you
guess it?” asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do,” said the fox. “But that will not save
you, for I can guess any riddle that ever was,”
and he fluffed up his tail, proud like and saucy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then guess this,” said Uncle Wiggily, and
now he had no trouble saying Peter Piper picked
the peck of pickled peppers. “Where is the
peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked?”
suddenly asked Uncle Wiggily of the fox. The
bad animal thought for a second and then he
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“If Peter pickled pecked a pick of pipered
pickles. A pick of Petered Pipers——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no!” laughed Uncle Wiggily. “You’re
a bit twisted. Try again.” The fox did so.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If Papper Peter pecked a pit of piddled
poppers——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Worse than ever,” said the bunny uncle. “I
think you will not find it as easy as you thought.
Once more, please, and try it a bit slower.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The fox growled, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“A pick of peppered Peters did peckle
pickle—— Oh, I can’t guess your old riddle!”
snarled the fox. “I’m going to eat you anyhow!
What do I care about the peckled pickers?” and
he made a jump for Uncle Wiggily to grab the
bunny uncle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Eat him? You going to eat Uncle Wiggily?
Oh, no! No, you’re not!” cried Peter
Piper, jumping out from behind the rock.
“Mother Goose doesn’t want Uncle Wiggily
hurt. Be off with you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And with that Peter threw a pickled pepper
at the fox. It struck him on the nose, and made
him sneeze and turn a somersault, and before he
could get straightened out Uncle Wiggily and
Peter Piper had run away to the duck house.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Mrs. Wibblewobble got the pickled peppers;
that is, all but the one Peter threw at the
fox, and Uncle Wiggily at last learned how to
say the hard riddle-verse without tying himself
in a knot. And if you can recite it, fast, without
wrinkling your nose, you are doing well.</p>

<p class='c011'>And if the candlestick doesn’t try to beat the
carpet, and get dust in the eyes of the potatoes
when they dance in the frying pan, I’ll tell you
next about Uncle Wiggily and the moon-man.</p>

  <h2 id='p2-Ch-VIII' class='c013'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE MOON-MAN</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Did</span> you hear the news, Uncle Wiggily?”
asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat
lady housekeeper, as she sat down one evening
in the dining-room of the hollow-stump bungalow,
where the rabbit gentleman was eating his
supper of lettuce salad, with carrot sauce
sprinkled on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“News! What news?” asked the bunny
uncle, reaching for a slice of carrot bread. “Is
some one going to have a surprise party and invite
us to dance?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s partly it,” Nurse Jane answered.
“Nannie Wagtail, the little goat girl, was going
to have a party, but she is ill, and the party will
not be given.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nannie ill? That’s too bad,” said Uncle
Wiggily, kindly. “I’ll go over to see her after
I have my supper. She may need cheering up a
bit. Yes, I’ll go see her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So after he had finished eating Uncle Wiggily
put on his tall silk hat that was like a piece of
the stovepipe and away he went, over the fields
and through the woods, to the house where the
little goat girl lived with her brother Billie and
her Uncle Butter, who posted circus pictures on
barns and fences.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was getting dark, but Uncle Wiggily was
not afraid, for he knew the moon would soon
rise above the tree tops and make a good light.</p>

<p class='c011'>And on his way to Nannie’s the bunny uncle
passed a candy store.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll just stop in and buy Nannie an ice cream
cone,” said Uncle Wiggily. “Winter is nearly
over and ice cream cones are in season again.
I’ll take two or three, for Billie might like one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The bunny uncle bought a bag full of the
ice cream cones, and he was walking on again,
hoping that Nannie would not be ill long, when,
all at once, there was a crash in the bushes beside
the rabbit gentleman as if some one had
fallen down.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My goodness me sakes alive and some apple
dumplings!” cried Uncle Wiggily, jumping to
one side. “Who it is?” He hoped it would
not prove to be the bad old fox. “Who is it?”
he asked, for it was too dark to see.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is I—the moon-man,” was the answer.
“I hope I did not scare you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, you did, a little,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“But what are you doing down on the earth?
You ought to be up in the sky.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know I ought,” said the other, “but you
know how Mother Goose has it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘The man in the moon came tumbling down,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To inquire the way to Norwich.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He went to the South,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And burned his mouth,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Eating some cold bean porridge.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“That’s how it was,” said the moon-man. “I
had to come tumbling down, you see, for that’s
the way it is in the book. But, oh, dear! I am
so sorry I burned my mouth! How it hurts!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you really burn your mouth, in the
South, eating cold bean porridge?” asked
Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did,” said the moon-man. “Only it was
hot when I ate it. It’s cold enough now, though.
Oh, how I burn! I wish you could help me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “See, I have
here some cold ice cream cones. Eat one of
them, and your mouth will stop burning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, thank you!” cried the moon-man, and,
surely enough, when he had eaten the ice cream
cone, his mouth was as cool as a refrigerator,
and he had no more pain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are very kind,” said the moon-man to
Uncle Wiggily. “If ever I can do you a favor
I will. But now I must jump back to my place
in the moon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The rabbit gentleman did not see how the
moon-man was going to do any one any favors,
if he had to jump away up in the moon, high
above the earth. But still Uncle Wiggily was
too polite to say so.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here I go! Good-by!” cried the man, and,
giving a big hop, up to the moon he jumped. If
you look closely you can see his face there on
moonlight nights. He is smiling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good-by!” called Uncle Wiggily, and on
he went to the Wagtail goats’ house to see
Nannie. She was very glad to have her bunny
uncle call, and more pleased still when he gave
her an ice cream cone, and also one to her
brother Billie.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily stayed for quite some time,
talking to the goats, and Uncle Butter told a
funny story about a circus picture of a dog,
which was so natural that a cat ran away when
she saw it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’ll be getting back to my bungalow,”
said Uncle Wiggily, after a bit. “Nurse Jane
will be worrying about me if I stay too late.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, how dark it is!” said Billie, looking out
the door. “Aren’t you afraid, Uncle Wiggily?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no,” answered the rabbit uncle. But,
when the door of the goats’ house was shut, and
the pleasant lamplight no longer streamed out,
it was very black and dark indeed. “I wish it
were time for the lightning bugs,” thought Mr.
Longears. “With them brightly flashing I
could easily see my way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily went on as best he could, but
pretty soon he bumped into a tree, and hurt his
pink, twinkling nose. Next he stumbled against
a big rock, and hurt his paw.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” he cried. “This is no fun! I
wish it were light so I could see where I am
going.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he tripped over a log and came down
ker-plunk! hurting his rheumatism, and he felt
very badly, indeed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I wish some one would help me find my
way to my bungalow!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll help you,” said a kind voice, and then
the woods were suddenly made almost as bright
as day, for the moon rose over the trees, and
shone down, so Uncle Wiggily could see the
path, and stumbled no more.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How is that?” asked the moon-man, beaming
down on Uncle Wiggily. “Do I make it
light enough for you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, indeed! Fine,” said the bunny uncle.
“I can see all right now. Thank you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the moon-man, whose mouth no longer
burned, thanks to the ice cream cone, shone
brightly until Uncle Wiggily safely reached his
bungalow.</p>

<p class='c011'>And, if the trolley car doesn’t go roller-skating
with the apple pie and upset the goldfish,
so they spill into the canary’s cage, I’ll tell you
next about Uncle Wiggily and Humpty
Dumpty.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='p2-Ch-IX' class='c013'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND HUMPTY DUMPTY</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily</span>, would you mind bringing
me some glue when you come home from your
walk this afternoon?” asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper, as she
saw the rabbit gentleman leaving his hollow-stump
bungalow one day.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Glue?” asked Uncle Wiggily, curious like.
“I hope you are not going to put it in my chair,
so when I sit down I will stick fast, and not be
able to get up again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no!” laughed Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy,
“though if you keep on going out so often, the
way you do, I’ll need a bit of sticky fly paper, or
something like that, to keep you at home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! I have to go off to have adventures
now and then,” said the bunny uncle, smiling so
that his nose twinkled like a moonbeam shining
in the water. “But I’ll bring you the glue all
right, Nurse Jane. What is it you want to stick
together?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A broken teacup,” answered the muskrat
lady. “I knocked a breakfast teacup off the
table, and it broke. But I can stick the pieces
together with glue, and it will be almost as good
as new.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “That’s the
way to do it!” Then he set off over the fields
and through the woods to get the glue.</p>

<p class='c011'>He found some in the doll doctor’s toy shop,
where the monkey-doodle toy-mender used it to
fasten together all the playthings the animal
boys and girls broke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s just the glue for Nurse Jane’s cup,”
said the doll doctor. “It will mend anything.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s what we want,” said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, the old gentleman rabbit was going
along, hoping he would meet with an adventure
before he reached his hollow-stump bungalow,
when, all at once, he heard a sort of crowing
noise and a clucking, and then a sad voice
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear, I might have known it would happen!
I should never have let you sit on top of
the wall, Humpty. Now look what you’ve done!
Oh, what will my mother say?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! That sounds like Charlie Chick, the
little rooster chap,” said Uncle Wiggily. “I
wonder what has happened to him, and who
Humpty can be? I guess I’ll look and see.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The bunny uncle went on a little farther and,
coming to a stone wall, he saw, on one side of it,
Charlie Chick; and the little rooster chap’s tail
feathers were all squeezed sideways and crooked,
as though he were in great trouble, indeed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Charlie!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“What’s the matter? Is Arabella, your sister,
lost?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, Uncle Wiggily!” answered
Charlie. “But I had Humpty Dumpty with
me, and he sat up on the wall, just as he did when
he was out with Mother Goose. But he fell off
and now he’s broken, and oh, dear! I fear he
never will be himself again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My! My! What’s all this?” asked Uncle
Wiggily. “I never heard of Humpty Dumpty,
or his fall from the wall. And why can’t he be
himself again? If it’s anything that is broken
I can mend it, for I have some glue to mend
Nurse Jane’s broken cup, and I can mend
Humpty Dumpty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, it’s very kind of you, I’m sure,” said
Charlie, politely, “but it can’t be done. You
see Humpty Dumpty is an egg. My mother,
Mrs. Cluck-Cluck, sent me to take him to Mrs.
Wibblewobble, the duck lady. But on the way
I stopped here to rest and I let Humpty sit upon
the wall.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, what happened then?” asked Uncle
Wiggily, as Charlie stopped, to give a little crow,
and flap his wings.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It happened just as it tells about in the
Mother Goose book,” went on Charlie. “This
is the way it was:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>All the king’s horses and all the king’s men,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Cannot put Humpty together again.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“Why can’t they put him together again?”
asked Uncle Wiggily. “Where is Humpty?
Let me have a look at him. If his shell is only
cracked I can mend it with glue. Where is he?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“On the other side of the stone wall,” answered
Charlie. “He fell over or rolled backward,
and he must be all broken up by now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let us hope for the best,” said the rabbit
gentleman. “He may be only cracked, Humpty
Dumpty may be, and if the glue I have for
Nurse Jane will mend a cracked cup, it will
mend a cracked egg. I must have a look.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Up on top of the wall jumped the rabbit gentleman.
Then he hopped down on the other
side. He looked around for Humpty Dumpty.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily saw some broken egg shells.
Then he looked some more and rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is queer,” he said. “If the egg broke,
the white and yellow inside ought to have run
out on the ground. But I don’t see any. That
must have been a hollow egg.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then the rabbit gentleman heard:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Peep! Peep! Peepity-peep-cheep-cheep!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My goodness me sakes alive and some corn-meal
pudding!” cried the bunny uncle. “Who
is that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is I, Humpty Dumpty,” was the answer,
and out from under a bush ran a cute, little,
fluffy, downy chicken.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you Humpty Dumpty?” cried Uncle
Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course,” peeped the little chicken. “I
was inside the eggshell all the while, just waiting
to come out. And when Charlie set me on
the wall I rolled off, cracked my shell and here
I am. I popped out!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course, it isn’t just like in the book,” said
the baby chick, “but it’s better. For though I
sat on the wall and had a great fall, I don’t need
all the king’s horses and all the king’s men to
put Humpty together again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, and you don’t need any of my glue,”
said Uncle Wiggily, with a laugh. “There is
no use mending a broken eggshell out of which
has come a chicken. Oh, I say, Charlie!” cried
the bunny uncle. “Fly over the wall. It’s all
right. Humpty is here, only he is different from
what you thought you would find him. Here
he is; a new, little chicken brother for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And wasn’t Charlie surprised? Well, I guess
yes! But he loved Humpty Dumpty very much
and Humpty loved him. So this time, once
more, everything came out all right, just as
Mother Goose would have it.</p>

<p class='c011'>And if the collar button doesn’t go to a necktie
party all by itself and leave the comb to play
tag with the brush, I’ll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and Old King Cole.</p>

  <h2 id='p2-Ch-X' class='c013'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND OLD KING COLE</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Well</span>, Uncle Wiggily Longears, you are
getting very stylish, indeed, it seems,” spoke
Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady
housekeeper, after the postman bird had paid
a visit to the hollow-stump bungalow one day,
and had left a letter. “Very stylish. Look
here!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, what’s the matter?” asked the bunny
uncle. “Do you call it stylish just to get a letter?
You often get them, and so do I. This is,
very likely, from Grandpa Goosey Gander, asking
me to come over and play checkers with
him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed, it is nothing of the sort!” exclaimed
the muskrat lady. “That is, if you will excuse
me for saying so. This is a very stylish letter, indeed.
It comes from the king’s palace, as you
can see, by the royal stamp on it in gold and red
and blue and green. I wonder what it can be?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll open it and find out; then I’ll tell you,”
said Uncle Wiggily, politely. “I guess it’s from
the gold and silver palace of the king, who was
in the kitchen counting out his money, while
the queen was in the parlor eating bread and
honey. The maid was in the garden hanging
out the clothes, when along came a blackbird
and nipped off her nose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I helped the king and queen and the maid,
you know, and perhaps they are in more trouble,
and need more help.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But when the bunny uncle opened the letter
he found it was not from that king, but another—this
letter was from Old King Cole.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Read me the letter,” said Nurse Jane.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Uncle Wiggily read:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Old King Cole is a merry old soul,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A merry old soul is he.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>He called for his pipe, he called for his bowl,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And he called for his fiddlers three.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Every fiddler had a fine fiddle,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>A very fine fiddle had he,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And Uncle Wiggily is asked to come</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To list to the music with me.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>At the bottom of the letter was Old King
Cole’s name, in big letters.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, well!” exclaimed Uncle Wiggily.
“I don’t understand. What’s it all about, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t you see!” cried Nurse Jane. “This
is a royal invitation from Old King Cole for you
to come to his palace, and listen to his fiddlers
three making music on their fine fiddles. You
must get ready to go. Put on your best suit and
look nice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Must I really go?” asked Uncle Wiggily.
“I had much rather stay here with you. I
don’t know Old King Cole at all well. Must I
go?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course you must go!” Nurse Jane said.
“Whenever a king invites you, why, you have
to go, even if you must stand on your head. I’ll
help you get ready.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well,” Uncle Wiggily said. “But I
had much rather stay home with my slippers on,
eating carrot sandwiches. I know it will be too
fine and grand for me up at the king’s palace.
I’ll be sure to get my napkin on backward, or
tickle some one with the wrong fork. But if I
must go, I must. I wonder how he came to invite
me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I guess he heard how kind you were to
the king who was in the kitchen, counting out
his money, and how you dug it up for him when
it rolled under the floor,” said Nurse Jane.</p>

<p class='c011'>So she helped Uncle Wiggily get ready, shaving
the back of his neck for him, where he
couldn’t himself reach with his razor. And she
tied his tie for him, and saw that he was all
scrumptious like, and proper.</p>

<p class='c011'>Finally the rabbit gentleman set off for the
palace of the king. He was about halfway
there when he heard some little squeaking voices
down beside the woodland path, and there he
saw Jollie and Jillie Longtail, the mouse children,
and their cousin, Squeaky-Eeky.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where are you going, Uncle Wiggily?”
asked Jollie, the boy mouse.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To Old King Cole’s to hear some fiddle
music,” answered Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, do please take us with you!” begged
Jillie. “We just love fiddle music and we can’t
ever go to hear any.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why?” asked the bunny uncle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because,” explained Squeaky-Eeky, the
little cousin mouse. “You know what it says
in Mother Goose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Hi-Diddle-Diddle. The cat’s in the fiddle.’
Now we couldn’t go to hear music when
a cat was in the fiddle, could we?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course not,” answered Uncle Wiggily.
“I never thought of that. Cats and mice don’t
go well together. But how can I take you to
King Cole? He may not like mice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Put us in your pockets,” said Jillie. “We
are not very big, and we can easily hide when
you go in the palace. No one will see us in your
pockets.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, Uncle Wiggily put them in—Jollie,
Jillie and Squeaky-Eeky Longtail. But the
rabbit gentleman was afraid lest the king might
not like it. However, let us see what happened,
as they say in story books.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Glad to see you, Uncle Wiggily!” cried Old
King Cole, as the bunny uncle came in the
grand palace. “Make yourself right at home!”
and the king clapped his hands. Then some one
sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Old King Cole is a merry old soul,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>A merry old soul is he.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>He called for his pipe,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>He called for his bowl,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And he called for his fiddlers three.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>In came the fiddlers, playing tweedle-dweele-dee,
making nice music, until, all at once:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Snap! Snap! Snap!” went something.
“Snap!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My goodness me sakes alive and some
orange lemonade!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“What was that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Our fiddle strings have broken!” cried one
of the fiddlers. “Now we can make no more
music until we have new strings.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” cried King Cole. “That’s too
bad. I must have music from my fiddlers three,
or from some one, or Mother Goose won’t like
it. How can I get squeaky fiddle music for
Uncle Wiggily? How can I?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then Jollie Longtail popped his head out
from Uncle Wiggily’s pocket.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you please, Old King Cole,” he said,
“Jillie, Squeaky-Eeky and I, with our squeaky
voices, will make music for you if you like.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do like,” said the king. “Make some
music, if you please!”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the mice, who have very squeaky voices,
sang nice music, almost like the fiddles, and
Old King Cole was a more merry soul than
ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m glad you came, Uncle Wiggily,” he
said. “And I’m glad you brought the nice
Longtail mice children with you. Give them
all some cheese!” And he laughed most jolly-jilly
like.</p>

<p class='c011'>So the mice sang for the king until the fiddlers’
fiddle strings were fixed, and every one had a
good time and plenty to eat.</p>

<p class='c011'>And if the jam tart doesn’t get inside the
huckleberry pie, where the egg beater can’t find
it to dance with, I’ll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and Peter-Peter.</p>

  <h2 id='p2-Ch-XI' class='c013'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND PETER-PETER</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily</span>, don’t you think you’d better
take an umbrella with you?” asked Nurse
Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper,
as the rabbit gentleman, Mr. Longears,
started out from his hollow-stump bungalow one
morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“An umbrella, Nurse Jane? Why should I
take one with me? I have my red, white and
blue-striped barber-pole rheumatism crutch, that
you gnawed for me out of a corn-stalk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That wouldn’t be much good in a rain-storm,”
said the muskrat lady, with a laugh.
“It wouldn’t keep off many of the drops.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I s’pose not,” said the bunny uncle, sort
of rubbing his pink, twinkling nose, thoughtful
like, with the brim of his tall silk hat. “So you
think it is going to rain, do you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Or snow,” said the muskrat lady, looking
to see if the hair ribbon had come off the end
of her tail, but it had not, I’m glad to say.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I guess I’ll be back before it storms,”
went on Uncle Wiggily. “I’m only going over
to Grandfather Goosey Gander’s pen house to
see if he wants to play checkers with grains of
corn. I won’t be very long,” and with that Uncle
Wiggily hopped away.</p>

<p class='c011'>Over the fields and through the woods hopped
the bunny uncle to the house, or pen, of the old
gentleman goose. Uncle Wiggily was thinking
what a nice visit he would have when, all of a
sudden, he heard from behind a scratchy briar
bush a sad voice saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! They’re all spilled! I’ll never
be able to pick them up; never! There are too
many of them! Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! That is funny talk. It sounds as
though some one were in trouble,” said Uncle
Wiggily to himself. “I wonder if I can help
them? I’ll just take a peek first, for it might
be the skillery-scalery alligator, with humps on
his tail, or the bad fox or wolf, and they would
help themselves to catch me rather than have me
help them. I’ll take a peek first.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Uncle Wiggily peeked out and there, on
the other side of the bush he saw a little man,
bending down and picking something up off the
ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, as a rule, the bunny uncle didn’t like
men, for most of them were hunters, with dogs
and bang-bang guns, who came after the animal
people. But this man was so little, and so kind-looking
and, withal, Uncle Wiggily could see
he had no gun, so Mr. Longears knew it would
be all right.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Excuse me,” said Uncle Wiggily, speaking
a language that animals and little men can understand.
“But can I help you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, hello, Uncle Wiggily,” exclaimed the
small chap. “Why, maybe you can help me.
You see, I am Peter-Peter, and——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What, not Peter-Peter, the Pumpkin-Eater?”
asked the rabbit gentleman, surprised
like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The very same,” was the answer. “I’m that
Peter-Peter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you must be a friend of Mother
Goose,” said the bunny uncle, smiling down one
side of his pink twinkling nose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am,” answered Peter-Peter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I am more than ever anxious to help
you,” spoke Mr. Longears. “I always help the
friends of Mother Goose. What is the
trouble?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have spilled all my pumpkin seeds,” was
the answer of Peter-Peter. “You see I was
scooping out my pumpkin shell, making it hollow
to keep my wife in, as it says in the Mother
Goose book. When I had the seeds all scooped
out my wife said it would be a good thing to take
them over to Mrs. Bushytail, the squirrel lady,
as she and her two boys, Johnnie and Billie,
could eat them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess they would be glad to get them,” said
Uncle Wiggily. “In fact, I like roasted pumpkin
seeds myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But the trouble is,” said Peter-Peter, “that
when I had put the seeds in a bag, and was on
my way to the Bushytail home with them, I came
through these woods. The prickly briar bush
caught my bag, tore holes in it, and out fell the
pumpkin seeds. They are scattered all over the
ground here, and, oh, dear! I’ll never be able
to pick them up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, you will,” said Uncle Wiggily, with
a jolly laugh. “I’ll help you, and I’ll get my
friends, Dickie and Nellie Chip-Chip, the sparrows,
to help. They are great at picking up
seeds.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Uncle Wiggily whistled for Dickie and
Nellie Chip-Chip, and when the sparrow boy
and girl came, with their sharp bills, they soon
picked up most of the pumpkin seeds; Uncle
Wiggily and Peter-Peter helping, of course.</p>

<p class='c011'>And when they were all picked up Uncle
Wiggily pasted some postage stamps over the
holes in Peter-Peter’s bag, so it was as good as
ever. Then the little man started off with it over
his shoulder to the Bushytail squirrel house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, very much, Uncle Wiggily,”
said Peter-Peter. “And you, too, Dickie and
Nellie. If ever I can do you a favor I will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he went on, and, when Dickie and Nellie
had flown home, Uncle Wiggily hopped along
to Grandpa Goosey Gander’s house. There the
old rabbit gentleman had a nice time playing
checkers with grains of corn, but on his way
home, when he was in the middle of the woods,
all of a sudden it began to rain very hard.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” cried the bunny uncle. “Nurse
Jane was right. It is raining, and I have no
umbrella! I will get all wet, and my rheumatism
will be worse than ever. Oh, dear! I wish I had
some place to go in!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And just then Uncle Wiggily heard a voice
singing.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Peter-Peter, Pumpkin-Eater,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Had a wife and could not keep her.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>He put her in a pumpkin shell,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And there he kept her very well.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Uncle Wiggily looked through the bushes,
and there he saw a cute little house, made from
a pumpkin, with a hollowed-out corn-cob for a
chimney. And in the door of the house stood
the little man, Peter-Peter himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hello, Uncle Wiggily!” called Peter-Peter.
“Come in out of the rain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is there room in there with you and your
wife?” asked the bunny uncle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Plenty of room,” answered Peter-Peter.
“This is an extra big Thanksgiving pumpkin.
Come in!”</p>

<p class='c011'>In went Uncle Wiggily out of the rain, and
he stayed in Peter-Peter’s pumpkin-shell house
until the storm was over, and he could go home
without getting wet. So you see it was a good
thing Uncle Wiggily helped Peter-Peter pick
up the pumpkin seeds.</p>

<p class='c011'>And if the rain-drop doesn’t fall down-stairs
and splash all over the pancake turner when it
goes out to shovel the snow, I’ll tell you next
about Uncle Wiggily and the butcher.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='p2-Ch-XII' class='c013'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BUTCHER</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>It</span> was raining in animal land, where Uncle
Wiggily Longears, the nice rabbit gentleman,
lived. It had been raining for several days; in
fact, ever since the bunny uncle had helped
Peter-Peter pick up the pumpkin seeds.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily had been caught out in the
rain then, and had gone in the pumpkin shell,
where Peter-Peter kept his wife very well. That
rain was only a shower, which was soon over,
but the storm began again and had lasted ever
since. It was very wet in animal land.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My!” exclaimed Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy,
the muskrat lady housekeeper. “If it doesn’t
stop soon I’ll never get the clothes dry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Worse than that,” said Uncle Wiggily. “If
it doesn’t stop soon there will be a flood, and our
hollow-stump bungalow will be full of water.
In fact, I think there is a little water in it now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, it kept on raining, and there was a flood,
so much so that Uncle Wiggily’s cellar was full
of water, almost up to the floor, and all about,
outside the hollow-stump bungalow, there were
little lakes and puddles and rivers of rain water
in the woods.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will it ever stop raining?” asked Nurse
Jane, as she stood at the window, looking out.
“If it doesn’t, I don’t know what we shall do. I
need some things from the store.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll get them for you,” said Uncle Wiggily,
kindly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But how can you, in all this rain?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, very easily,” answered the bunny uncle,
twinkling his pink nose to make himself bright
and cheerful like. “I’ll put on my rubber boots,
my raincoat, take an umbrella and go to the
store.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’m sure it’s very brave of you to go
out in this storm,” said Nurse Jane, “and I hope
your rheumatism doesn’t catch cold. But we
need some bread, sugar, salt and other things.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll get them,” said Uncle Wiggily, and off
he started through the storm, well wrapped up
so he would get no wetter than could be helped.</p>

<p class='c011'>The rabbit uncle finally got to the store, and
the monkey-doodle gentleman who kept it put
in a basket the things Nurse Jane wanted.</p>

<p class='c011'>He wrapped them in heavy paper, putting
some over the top of the basket so in case Uncle
Wiggily’s umbrella blew wrong side out the
groceries would not get wet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I guess everything is going to be all
right,” thought Uncle Wiggily to himself, as he
hopped along through the rain on his way back
to the hollow-stump bungalow. “I don’t believe
I’m even going to have an adventure (except
now and then splashing into a puddle) for all
my coming out in the storm. And I haven’t had
an adventure in some time. I really wish something
would happen!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily had no sooner thought this
than, all of a sudden, something did happen.
He slipped into a big puddle with his rubber
boots. The water came nearly to the top of them,
but that did not so much matter as did something
else. For when the bunny uncle tried to pull
his feet up out of the puddle he couldn’t do it.
No, sir, he could no more pull his feet up than
you could get loose from sticky fly paper in case
you happened to sit down in it, which, I hope,
you never do; though our cat did once. And
such a time!</p>

<p class='c011'>“My! This is quite too bad!” cried Uncle
Wiggily. “I wonder what could have happened?
My feet are caught fast!” He
squirmed about a bit with his feet in the rubber
boots. Then he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know what has happened. My feet are
held tight in the crooked, twisted old root of a
tree that is down under the puddle. I’m caught
as badly as if I were in a trap. Oh, dear! This
is an adventure, all right, but not the kind I like.
I wonder how I can get loose?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And well might the bunny uncle wonder. His
feet were caught fast in the root, away down
under water and he could not reach down with
his paws to loosen them, for he had his umbrella
in one paw and the basket of groceries on the
other, for there was water all around him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “I s’pose
I could pull my feet out of the rubber boots and
just leave them caught in the puddle, but if I
did that I’d have to go home bare-pawed, and
I’d catch my rheumatism worse than ever. Oh,
dear! What shall I do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then, through the woods Uncle Wiggily
heard the sound of a drum. “Dub-dub! Dubbity-dubbity-dub!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! I wonder if that can be Sammie Littletail,
the bunny boy, coming along with his
Christmas drum? If it is he can help me,” said
Mr. Longears.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily, still caught fast, looked
through the trees, and he saw some one sailing
along in a washtub. And it was the butcher
man, in his white apron and cap, with a big
knife in his hand, who was drumming, with the
knife handle, on the sides of the tub. And the
butcher sang this song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Rub-a-dub-dub! Three men in a tub;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>They all jumped over a hard baked potato.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“Why, that’s in Mother Goose!” cried Uncle
Wiggily, joyful like. “This butcher must be
a friend of hers. I wonder if he could help
me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then the butcher saw Uncle Wiggily
caught fast in the puddle, and, stopping his
washtub ship, he asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you in trouble?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Trouble? I should say I was!” cried the
bunny uncle. “My feet are caught fast in a
tree root down under the water, and I can’t
get loose. Can you help me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can and will,” replied the butcher. Then,
with his long, sharp knife, he reached down under
the puddle and cut the tree root that was
holding Uncle Wiggily’s feet fast, taking care
not to cut the bunny uncle’s rubber boots.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There you are!” cried the butcher. “Now
you’re loose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, thank you so much,” said Uncle Wiggily,
hopping out of the puddle. “But, excuse
me, I thought there were three of you rub-a-dub-dub
men in a tub. You are only one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, there were three of us,” said the
butcher. “But since Mother Goose wrote that
verse about us, after we jumped out of the baked
potato, we grew so large that three of us had hard
work to fit in one tub. So now we each have a
tub to ourselves. Now I must sail on. The
baker and candlestick maker and I are having a
tub-boat-race. I hope I win. Good-by!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And on he sailed in his tub, while Uncle Wiggily,
his feet no longer caught fast, went safely
on to his hollow-stump bungalow through the
rain with the groceries.</p>

<p class='c011'>So the bunny uncle was saved by the butcher,
you see, and, if the gas lamp doesn’t go down
cellar in the dark and stumble over the fire shovel
when it’s playing in the ashes, I’ll tell you next
about Uncle Wiggily and the baker.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='p2-Ch-XIII' class='c013'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BAKER</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>It</span> was still raining in Woodland, where the
animal folk lived. All around the hollow-stump
bungalow, where Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the
muskrat lady, kept house for Uncle Wiggily
Longears, the rabbit gentleman, there were puddles
of water; little lakes and rivers, too.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think it is getting colder,” said Uncle Wiggily,
as he came in from having been up to the
Orange Mountain, to get a dozen of lemons so
Nurse Jane could bake a cherry pie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If it gets colder, perhaps it will stop raining,”
Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy remarked, “and goodness
knows we have had enough of water.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, a little snow for a change would seem
nice,” spoke the bunny uncle, looking out of the
window at the rain-drops still splashing down.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was it raining on the Orange Mountain?”
Nurse Jane wanted to know.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, just as hard as it is down here in the
valley. But the water runs off the sides of the
mountain, so there are not so many puddles to
step in, as I stepped in one the other day, and got
my foot caught in a tree root, when the butcher,
in his rub-a-dub-dub tub, cut me loose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was quite an adventure,” said Nurse
Jane. “You haven’t seen the other friends of
Mother Goose—the baker and the candlestick
maker—have you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” Uncle Wiggily answered. “But I understand
that the butcher’s two friends, the baker
and the candlestick maker, are having a race
with him, each one in a tub. They may sail
along any day now. I guess I’ll go out and look
for them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What! In all this rain?” cried Nurse Jane,
in surprise. “You’ll catch cold in your rheumatism,
I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, I’ll wrap up well in my rubber coat,
and put on my rubber boots as I did before,” said
the bunny uncle, making his nose twinkle like
a gold tooth in the wax doll.</p>

<p class='c011'>Off started the old rabbit gentleman, carrying
a big umbrella so that too many rain-drops
would not get on his tall silk hat. He walked
along through the woods, down from the trees
of which the rain-drops dripped. There were
many puddles, but Uncle Wiggily kept as much
out of them as he could.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is getting quite some colder,” he said to
himself, as he put one paw in his pocket to warm
it—warm his paw, I mean, not his pocket, for
that was warm already. “I wouldn’t be surprised
to see it snow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And, in a little while, a few flakes of snow did
begin to fall, dodging their way in between the
rain-drops, and sort of playing tag with one another.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How pretty the flakes look,” said Uncle
Wiggily, coming to a stop to watch them. “I
think I’ll sit down a minute and look at them.”
He found a fallen log, which, being under a
Christmas tree, was not as wet as it might otherwise
have been, and down Uncle Wiggily sat on
that.</p>

<p class='c011'>More snowflakes fell, and they looked so
pretty that Uncle Wiggily stayed longer than he
meant to, sitting on the log. It kept on getting
colder and colder, and finally the bunny uncle
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I mustn’t sit here any longer. I’ll get
up and go back to my nice, warm, cozy hollow-stump
bungalow. Yes, I’ll get up and——”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Uncle Wiggily did not get up. He
couldn’t! He had frozen fast to the log, which
had some water on it. The cold air had made
the water freeze, and Uncle Wiggily was held
as fast there as if he had sat down in sticky fly
paper—even more tightly, I believe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” he cried. “This is quite too
bad! In fact, it is terrible. What shall I
do!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He tried to get up, but he could not, and he
did not want to take off his rubber coat, and so
free himself, for fear he might catch cold without
his coat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! I don’t know what to do!” cried
Uncle Wiggily. “Help! Help! Will no one
help me to get loose?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, through the woods he suddenly heard a
rub-a-dub-dub drumming sound.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! I wonder if that can be my friend, the
butcher?” thought the bunny uncle. But when
he looked he saw a baker coming along, dressed
in a spotless white apron and cap. The baker
had a loaf of bread in his hand, and with a large
spoon he was pushing himself along in his tub
through the puddles of water, which had not yet
solidly frozen over, though there were chunks of
ice in them. And the baker was singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Rub-a-dub-dub, three men in a tub;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But I am the one with the hot baked potato.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Then the baker, seeing Uncle Wiggily sitting
on the log, called to the bunny uncle as he
stopped his tub boat:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would you like to buy a loaf of bread?”
asked the baker.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, yes, I might, for I heard Nurse Jane
say we needed some,” answered the bunny uncle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then please come and get it,” said the baker.
“For I am riding a boat-tub race with the
butcher and the candlestick maker, and I don’t
want to stop. They might get in ahead of me.
You see, we are doing a little different from what
it says in the Mother Goose book,” went on the
baker, shaking some rain-drops off his white cap.
“We each have a tub to ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I see,” said Uncle Wiggily. “I heard about
it. In fact, I met the butcher sailing along in
his tub the other day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, did you? Then I must hurry,” cried the
baker, “or he will win the race. Come and get
your loaf of bread and I’ll paddle along.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can’t come and get it,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“I am sorry, but I really can’t.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why not?” asked the baker.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because I am frozen fast to this log,” said
the bunny uncle, “and I really can’t get up,
much as I would like to. I was calling for help,
and, when you came along, I hoped——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! Say no more!” cried the baker, in a
jolly voice. “Of course I’ll help you. Never
mind about the race. I’ll get you loose!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How?” asked Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll show you!” cried the baker. He stopped
his tub, which had started off by itself, put on
his rubbers, and stepped out into a little puddle.
In his hands he carried the hot loaf of bread, and
the hot baked potato. Putting these down on
the log, one on each side of Uncle Wiggily, the
heat of them soon melted the ice, and the rabbit
gentleman was unfrozen, and could get up and
go on his way as well as ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, thank you!” he called to the baker.
“Thank you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are welcome,” was the answer, “and
take the hot bread and potato with you,” and
with that the baker jumped back in his tub and
went on sailing, hoping to catch up to the
butcher.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Uncle Wiggily went to his hollow-stump
bungalow, not being frozen any more, and all
was well. And if the soft boiled egg doesn’t go
sliding on the ice and fall down so it breaks all
to pieces and has to be put in a pudding, I’ll tell
you next about Uncle Wiggily and the candlestick
maker.</p>

  <h2 id='p2-Ch-XIV' class='c013'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE CANDLESTICK MAKER</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>After</span> supper, one night, Uncle Wiggily
Longears, the rabbit gentleman, put on his tall
silk hat, his fur-lined overcoat, and, taking his
red, white and blue-striped barber-pole rheumatism
crutch down off the piano, he started for
the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What! You are not going out to-night, are
you?” asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the
muskrat lady housekeeper, in surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, yes, for a little while,” answered the
bunny uncle. “It has stopped raining, you
know, and the ground has dried up. It is cold,
but I have my fur coat, so I shall be nice and
warm.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where are you going?” asked Nurse Jane.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To call on Mr. Longtail, the mouse gentleman.
He likes night visits better than day ones,
so that’s why I go in the evening. He’s like an
owl that way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, don’t stay too late,” said Nurse Jane,
and Uncle Wiggily promised that he would not.
Out into the night he went, but it was not very
dark, for there was a moon shining. And as the
rabbit uncle was hopping along through the
woods he suddenly stepped upon something
round, which rolled from under his paw and almost
threw him down.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! I wonder what that can be?” Uncle
Wiggily said. He looked and saw a brass
candlestick on the ground. “This is queer,”
went on the bunny uncle. “I did not know that
candlesticks grew in the woods. Some one must
have dropped it. I’ll take it with me, and perhaps
Mr. Longtail will know whose it is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With the candlestick in one paw and his
rheumatism crutch in the other, Uncle Wiggily
once more hopped on. Pretty soon he saw a
little light flickering through the trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, that looks just like a lightning bug,”
said the bunny uncle, “only they are not out this
time of the year. I wonder what that can be?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he heard a tummity-tum-tum, drumming
sound, and a voice sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Rub-a-dub-dub, three men in a tub;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And the baker has taken the hot baked potato.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“Why, that must be the last of the three, queer
Mother Goose men, who went sailing a race in
washtubs, when the weather was rainy,” said
Uncle Wiggily. “And this one must be the
candlestick maker, for I have met the other two.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But if this is the candlestick maker I don’t
see how he can be sailing in his tub when the
rain has stopped, and there are no little rivers,
lakes or even puddles in the woods,” went on the
rabbit gentleman. “Everything is frozen over.
I don’t see how he can.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the singing voice stopped, and Uncle
Wiggily heard some one crying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! Ouch, how it burns! Oh, where
can it be? Where can it be?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The flickering light came nearer, and Uncle
Wiggily, looking through the trees, saw that it
was not a lightning bug, or firefly, but a little
man, with a leather apron on, and a hammer and
other tools hanging from his belt. The tools
jingled and rattled. Behind the man, who was
pulling it along as if it were a sled, with a rope
through one the handles, was the washtub. In
one hand the man carried a lighted candle, and,
all the while, he kept on saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! Ouch! How it burns me!
Oh, my!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Excuse me,” said Uncle Wiggily, politely,
“but you seem to be in trouble. Perhaps I can
help you. What burns you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“This candle,” answered the man. “I ought
to have a candlestick to hold it, but I dropped my
nice brass candlestick as I ran through the
woods, and now I have to hold the candle in my
bare fingers. And it is so short that it burns me.
Ouch!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! Then this is what you want,” Uncle
Wiggily said, and he handed over the candlestick
he had picked up.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The very thing!” cried the little man, in delight.
“Thank you so much. Now my fingers
won’t burn any more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He stuck the end of the lighted candle in the
stick and spoke again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m the candlestick maker, as you can see;
I make candlesticks, but just now I am not making
any, as I am on a race with the butcher and
baker to see who first will get to Mother Goose’s
house. We started out in a dreadful rain-storm,
when we could float in our tubs like boats, but
the butcher and baker seem to have gotten ahead
of me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They have,” said Uncle Wiggily. “I met
them two days ago.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then there isn’t much use in my keeping
on,” said the candlestick maker. “But it has
gotten colder. It may snow, and if I come to
a hill I can coast down it in my tub, which I made
into a sled when I found the ground frozen and
all the water gone. If I can slide down hill in
my tub-sled I may yet get ahead of the butcher
and baker and win the prize of a hot baked
potato.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps you may,” said Uncle Wiggily, as
he told how the baker had kindly thawed him off
the frozen log with the hot baked potato and a
hot loaf of bread.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’ll be getting on,” said the candlestick
maker, after a bit. “Thank you for being kind
to me. If ever I can do you a favor I will. My
fingers no longer burn.” Then he hurried off
through the woods, dragging his tub-sled after
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily had a nice visit with Mr.
Longtail, the mouse gentleman, but when the
bunny uncle started home the moon had gone
down and it was very dark. Soon Uncle Wiggily
was lost in the woods. He could not tell
which way to go, and he hopped around, stubbing
his paws and bunking into trees, until he
was all sore and lame.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I wish I had a light!” he cried. And,
no sooner had he spoken than he heard a drumming
sound, and along came the candlestick
maker with the lighted candle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here you are! Here’s your light, Uncle
Wiggily!” the candlestick maker cried. “I’ll
light you all the way to your hollow-stump bungalow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good!” cried the bunny uncle. “But I
don’t want to take your time and delay you. I
thought you were racing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I gave it up. The baker won and got there
first. I just met Old Mother Hubbard and she
told me. So I’m going to take you home.” And
he did, making the woods light with his candle,
all the way to the bunny uncle’s hollow-stump
bungalow.</p>

<p class='c011'>So the rabbit gentleman was all right again,
you see, and if the piece of cheese doesn’t run
away from the slice of apple pie, and get lost in
the rice pudding, I’ll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and Tom-Tom.</p>

  <h2 id='p2-Ch-XV' class='c013'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND TOM-TOM</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily Longears</span>, the nice rabbit
gentleman, was going along through the woods
one day, wondering what sort of an adventure
he would have, when he met Mother Goose, who,
as I have told you before, had come, with her
large family of funny folk, to live in the forest
near the hollow-stump bungalow of the bunny
uncle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How do you do, Mother Goose?” asked Mr.
Longears, as he made a polite bow, taking off his
tall silk hat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am very well, thank you,” she said. “You
look well yourself. I wonder if you have seen
him anywhere, as you have been walking
along?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Seen whom?” asked Uncle Wiggily. “If
you mean the butcher, the baker, and the candlestick
maker, I have. I met them the other
day——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, thank you, I don’t mean them,” said
Mother Goose. “They have come safely home
again with their rub-a-dub-dub-tubs, and they
are happily living together once more. No, it’s
another of my friends who is lost. You may
have seen him. He is——”</p>

<p class='c011'>But just then Old Mother Hubbard came to
the door of her house, after having given her dog
a bone, and she called across the woodland path:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Mother Goose! Little Tommie Tucker
is crying for his supper. What shall I give him,
white bread and butter?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wait a minute. I’ll be right there,” answered
Mother Goose. “I want to put a little
molasses on Tommie’s bread. You walk on,”
she said to Uncle Wiggily. “I’ll come back to
you in a minute and tell you who is lost.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Mother Goose must have had to give
Tommie Tucker a bigger supper than usual, or
else some of her other friends wanted something,
for Uncle Wiggily hopped on and on, and
the nice old goose lady did not come to speak to
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s funny,” said the bunny uncle, “but I
wonder who it is that is lost? I can’t very well
look for him—or her—until I know. It may be
Little Bo Peep, or Jack Horner. Well, I’ll keep
on, and I may meet with the lost one, whoever
he or she is; or I may have an adventure. Who
knows?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, the bunny uncle had not gone on much
farther before, all at once, he heard some one
running through the bushes, and the sound of
loud squeals.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! Something is happening,” said Uncle
Wiggily. “Perhaps this is the adventure I am
expecting.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, all of a sudden, through the bushes
came running a boy with a squealing pig under
his arm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Squee! Squee! Squee!” cried the pig.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hold on! Stop! Wait a minute!” cried
Uncle Wiggily. “Who are you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am Tom-Tom, the piper’s son,” was the
answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, you’re from Mother Goose, aren’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but I’m running away from her now,”
answered Tom-Tom. “You know how it goes
in the book:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Tom-Tom, the piper’s son,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Took a pig and away he run.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The pig was eat, and Tom was beat,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And he went roaring down the street.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“That’s how it is in the book,” went on
Tom-Tom. “Only it isn’t exactly right. I
didn’t do any roaring, though I may when I get
the beating. It’s the pig who is doing the
roaring.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It sounds more like squealing,” said Uncle
Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, you could call it that,” said Tom-Tom,
as he looked at the pig under his arm, which
cried louder than before. I mean the pig
squealed, not Tom-Tom’s arm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But look here,” said Uncle Wiggily. “You
should not have taken this pig. That’s quite
wrong you know, Tom-Tom. Besides, Mother
Goose is after you. I just met her, and she
started to tell me about some of her friends being
lost. She asked me to help look for him—or her—but
before she could tell me who it was, she
was called away. It must have been you she
meant.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was,” said Tom-Tom. “I had to run after
I took the pig, but the funny part of it is I can’t
find any street to run down, as the book says I
did. It’s all woods around here; no streets at
all. I’d run with the pig down the street, fast
enough, if I could find one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no! You mustn’t do that,” said Uncle
Wiggily. “You only go down the street after
the pig was eat, or eaten, to be more correct. Besides,
you ought not to take the pig at all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What shall I do?” asked Tom-Tom. “I
have the pig now, you see. What must I do with
it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll take him with me,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“I can lead him back home, and then you must
go tell Mother Goose you’re sorry, and I don’t
believe she’ll whip you or beat you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right,” said Tom-Tom, the piper’s son.
“I’ll do as you say.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He gave Uncle Wiggily the pig, which was
a baby one, and the bunny gentleman led it
along by a string, while Tom-Tom hurried off to
tell Mother Goose he was sorry that he had been
a little bad. And Mother Goose forgave him,
and did not whip him, so Tom-Tom did not have
to go roaring down the street after all.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, what have you there, Uncle Wiggily?”
asked Nurse Jane, when she saw the
bunny gentleman coming along leading a pig.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is the pig Tom-Tom had,” said Mr.
Longears, and then, all at once, before he could
say anything more, the pig began to squeal with
all his might and so loudly that Nurse Jane
could not hear the bunny uncle’s voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mercy,” cried the muskrat lady. “What a
noise!” and she put her paws over her ears.
“Take him away, Wiggy, do. That’s a dear!
Take him away!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Squee! Squee! Squee!” yelled the baby
pig. And then along came Mother Hubbard’s
dog.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! So here’s where you are, eh?” asked
the dog. “Well, you come right back to your
pen!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will, and right gladly,” squealed the pig,
“and don’t let Tom-Tom take me again.
Thank you, Uncle Wiggily, for bringing me
this far.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the dog led the pig home by the ear,
piggie squealing all the way, but he stopped
when Mother Goose gave him something to eat.
And Tom-Tom never took the pig again, so the
little boy did not have to run roaring down the
street, I’m glad to say.</p>

<p class='c011'>And, if the sugar spoon doesn’t whisper to
the butter knife and have to stay on the table
after the rest of the dishes go to the sink to be
washed, I’ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily
and the crooked man.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='p2-Ch-XVI' class='c013'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE CROOKED MAN</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Heigh-ho</span>! Away I go!” sang Uncle Wiggily
Longears, the rabbit gentleman, one day,
as he looked in the glass to see if his whiskers
were on straight, and his nose twinkling just
right.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What? Away again?” asked Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper of
the hollow-stump bungalow, as she finished drying
the dinner dishes. “You seem to me to go
out a great deal, Mr. Longears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Far be it from me,” she went on, “to say
anything about it, but I should think you would
get tired of going around so much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no,” Uncle Wiggily laughed. “I like
it. I have a new adventure nearly every day,
and I think it is good for my rheumatism. So,
heigh-ho! Away I go!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Off through the woods went Uncle Wiggily.
It would soon be Spring now, and already the
pussy willows were just beginning to learn how
to mew a little bit, like baby cats.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the rabbit gentleman went along he saw,
lying on the path in front of him, a piece of
money. But it was a very queer bit of money,
indeed. It was all bent and twisted and crooked,
as though a trolley car had stepped on it by mistake,
and on one side was a figure six.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, maybe this will bring me good luck,”
said Uncle Wiggily. “It doesn’t seem to be
good for much else—such crooked money. A
six-cent piece, I guess it was once. I’ll just put
it in my pocket.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he did, and he walked along a little farther,
until, coming to a place where a great, big tree
had fallen to the ground, Uncle Wiggily heard
some one sitting on it saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! I’ve lost it! I can’t find it anywhere,
and without it I don’t see how I can do
what it says in the Mother Goose book I must
do. It’s lost—gone!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily looked and saw, sitting on the
fallen tree, a very funny, but nice, old man.
And the man was very crooked. He was bent
and twisted until there was not a straight place
on him, not even his nose, which was wobbled
and bent over to one side, and his ears were
folded together like pieces of paper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, well,” said Uncle Wiggily, feeling
sorry for so crooked a man, “this is too bad. I
wonder what happened to him to make him so
bent, and I wonder what he has lost?” for the
crooked, twisted man was turning his pockets
inside out, and even his pockets were curled
around like a corkscrew.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, such trouble as I am in!” cried the man.
“Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha, trouble! That means here is a chance
for me to help,” said the bunny uncle. “Excuse
me,” he said, “but who are you, and can I do
anything to help you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! Uncle Wiggily Longears! I know
you by your pictures!” said the man. “Don’t
you know me? I’m in the book that Mother
Goose wrote. It says about me that once</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘There was a crooked man,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Who walked a crooked mile,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And found a crooked sixpence</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Against a crooked stile.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>He bought a crooked cat,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Which caught a crooked mouse,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And they all lived together</div>
      <div class='line in3'>In a little crooked house.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“That’s who I am,” said the man. “But now
I’ll never be able to buy the crooked cat to catch
the crooked mouse, and live with me forever in
my little crooked house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why not?” asked Uncle Wiggily, sort of
wondering like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because I lost the crooked sixpence,” said
the crooked man. “I found it against the
crooked stile all right, after I’d walked the
crooked mile. The road did twist and turn like
a carpenter’s shaving, so it was crooked all right.
And when I came to the stile, which is a pair of
steps to get over a fence—a pair on each side—they
were so crooked I could hardly get over
them. And there was the crooked sixpence.
But I must have lost it out of my pocket, for I
haven’t it now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is this it?” asked Uncle Wiggily, as he took
the crooked piece of money out of his ear, which
he sometimes used as a pocket.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, that’s just it!” cried the crooked man,
in delight. “How ever did you find it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was lying on the path in the woods,” said
the bunny uncle, “and I picked it up. You may
have it back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, now I am all right!” laughed the
crooked man. “I can buy the crooked cat, and
it will catch a crooked mouse, and then we’ll
walk along and find our little, crooked house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But please don’t let your crooked cat catch
my little mice friends, Jollie or Jillie Longtail,
or Squeaky-Eeky, the cousin mouse?” begged
Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, indeed not!” promised the crooked
man. “My crooked cat will only catch a
crooked candy mouse. Perhaps you would like
to come with me and see me buy the crooked
cat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would,” spoke Uncle Wiggily. “I’ll
come.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The crooked man started off, twisting this
way and that as he walked along the crooked
mile, and Uncle Wiggily, who was sort of curious
and inquisitive, asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What made you get all twisted up this
way?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rheumatism,” was the crooked man’s answer.
“But I don’t mind now, for I have no
pain. In fact, I think it’s quite jolly to be
crooked and live in a crooked house. It’s so different
from other people.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said Uncle Wiggily, “it is certainly
different. But it is nice that you are so happy
about it. Some folks would be sad. I’m glad
you are jolly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Pretty soon the two friends came to where
crooked cats were sold for crooked money. By
this time Uncle Wiggily was so tired, from having
to jump back and forth to follow the crooked
man walking a crooked mile, that the bunny
uncle thought he would go back to his hollow-stump
bungalow and rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the crooked man, after he had bought the
crooked cat, still went along with Uncle Wiggily,
and it was a good thing he did. For, when
Uncle Wiggily was about halfway home, out
from behind a stump a bad old fox jumped at
him. Zip!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, ha!” cried the fox. “Now I have
you!” And then he saw the crooked man and
crooked cat, the fox did, and he rubbed his eyes
with his paws, once or twice, and cried out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! What does this mean? I must be
asleep and dreaming, for never can there really
be such strange, crooked things in this world as
that crooked man and cat. I must be dreaming,
and pretty soon I’ll wake up in my den. I’ll just
lie quietly and not move, or I might have a worse
dream.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And, thinking it was all a dream, the fox lay
down in the woods to sleep, and so he didn’t get
Uncle Wiggily after all, thanks to the crooked
man and cat. The bunny uncle hurried away
from the sleeping fox, and the twisted chap, with
the doubled-up pussy, soon reached their own
crooked house, where they lived happily for
many crooked years, catching crooked candy
mousies that cried crooked candy tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>So no more at present, if you please. But in
the next chapter, if the olive oil and the vinegar
speak nicely to each other when they meet at
the party in the lettuce salad, I’ll tell you about
Uncle Wiggily and the barber.</p>

  <h2 id='p2-Ch-XVII' class='c013'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BARBER</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily Longears</span>, the nice old rabbit
gentleman, walked across the sitting-room of
his hollow-stump bungalow, to where a looking-glass
hung on the wall. He looked in the glass,
and rubbed his paw, thoughtful like, up and
down his chin.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the matter?” asked Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady housekeeper.
“Did something bite you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” answered Uncle Wiggily, “but I
think I need to shave off some of my whiskers.
They are getting too long. Also I need a hair
cut.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gracious goodness me sakes alive, and some
corn-meal muffin lollypops!” exclaimed Nurse
Jane. “What for? A shave! A hair cut!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, you see,” exclaimed Uncle Wiggily,
“Spring is nearly here now, and, though I let
my hair and whiskers grow long in the cold
weather, to keep me warm, I don’t need them so
long now, as it is getting warmer. So I shall go
to the barber’s.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why don’t you shave yourself?” asked
Nurse Jane.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I could do that,” the bunny uncle said.
“Only I can’t very well cut my own hair. So
I might as well have both done by the barber.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old gentleman rabbit, taking his red,
white and blue-striped barber-pole rheumatism
crutch down off the bathtub, started out through
the woods and across the fields for the barber’s.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Longears had not gone very far before
he came to the house where Mother Goose lived.
She was up bright and early, shaking out her
feather beds; and, seeing the old rabbit gentleman,
she asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To the monkey-doodle barber’s to get
shaved,” replied Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, would you just as soon go to my barber’s?”
asked Mother Goose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your barber’s? I didn’t know you had
one,” said Uncle Wiggily, sort of laughing. “I
didn’t know you ladies had your hair cut.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We don’t,” spoke Mother Goose. “But
this barber is one of the friends in my story book,
you know, and I’d like to give him something
to do. You must have heard of him.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Barber, barber, shave a pig.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>How many hairs will make a wig?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Four-and-twenty, that’s enough.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Give the barber a pinch of snuff.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“Oh, I’ve often heard of him!” said Uncle
Wiggily. “But I haven’t a pinch of snuff to
give him, and besides I don’t need a wig.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, well, you don’t have to take a wig,” said
Mother Goose. “As for the snuff, tell him I’ll
send little Tommie Tucker down with it later.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Another thing,” spoke Uncle Wiggily. “If
that barber of yours is shaving a pig I don’t believe
he’ll have time to shave me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, that will be all right,” said Mother
Goose, laughing. “He doesn’t really shave a
pig. I just put ‘pig’ in to make it rhyme with
‘wig.’ Hop along now, and get shaved. The
barber lives down the lane, with the little boy
who was given the bag of wool from Baa-Baa,
the black sheep.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very good,” answered Uncle Wiggily, politely.
So along he hopped, to the barber shop,
which he soon reached. Out in front was a red,
white and blue-striped pole, like the rabbit gentleman’s
rheumatism crutch, and inside the shop
was the barber man, a little chap, not much
larger than the bunny uncle himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shave? Hair cut? Shampoo? Massage?
Manicure?” asked the barber, clicking his
scissors.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just a shave and hair cut,” answered Uncle
Wiggily, getting in the chair, while the barber
tucked an apron under the bunny’s chin.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fine weather we’re having,” said the barber,
as he began to cut Uncle Wiggily’s hairy
fur.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very,” said Uncle Wiggily. “To-morrow
is the first day of Spring, and that’s why I’m
getting a hair cut, to be ready for warmer
weather.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good!” said the barber. Then, when he
had Uncle Wiggily’s hair half cut, the barber
stopped and began to mix up some soap suds
lather in a cup.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are you doing?” asked Uncle Wiggily.
“Why don’t you finish cutting my hair
before you shave me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because my scissors are too dull. They
would pull. I’ll send them to the scissors-to-grind
man to be sharpened, and, while I’m waiting
for them to come back I’ll shave you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he began to shave the bunny uncle’s whiskers,
talking all the while about the weather and
what a hard Winter it had been, and how much
carrots cost and all of that.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, all of a sudden, when Uncle Wiggily
was half shaved, there was a whistling sound
out in front of the barber shop, and a voice sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Barber, barber, shave a pig,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>How many hairs will make a wig?</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Four-and-twenty, that’s enough.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Give the barber a pinch of snuff!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Into the shop came little Tommie Tucker.
He had a paper package in his hand, and he
tossed it across the room to the barber, saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here’s your pinch of snuff. Mother Goose
sent me with it. How is Uncle Wiggily’s shave
and hair cut coming off?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is coming off all—aker-choo! Kersnitzio!
Aker-ker-foozilum-goozilum—choo-chee!”
sneezed the barber, wiping some tears
out his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, my!” laughed Tommie Tucker.
“What kind of a shave and hair cut is a ker-choo!
Oh-er—Snitzio! Whoo-ee-whoop-gizzium!”
and Tommie himself was sneezing, too.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s all this?” asked Uncle Wiggily.
“Why don’t you finish my—ker-choo! Goo-zoo!
Gizzium! Whush! Oh-ker-skee-zicks!”
And he sneezed so hard that he sneezed himself
right out of the barber’s chair into the middle of
the room. Then they were all sneezing, the
barber, Uncle Wiggily and Tommie Tucker.
For you see when Tommie tossed the barber the
paper of snuff Mother Goose had sent the paper
burst open and the snuff scattered all about the
place. All over the shop floated the sneezy stuff.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ker-choo!” sneezed the barber.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A-ker-choo-choo!” sneezed Tommie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A-ker-choo-choo-choo! Toot-toot! All
aboard!” and Uncle Wiggily sneezed like a
railroad train going through a tunnel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’m so sorry,” said Tommie Tucker.
“I should not have been so careless.” But soon
all the snuff blew out of the window, the sneezes
stopped, and the barber finished shaving and
hair cutting Uncle Wiggily, and that’s the end
of this story.</p>

<p class='c011'>But if the man beating our carpets doesn’t
stop to play marbles with the moth balls, and
make the roller-skates feel lonesome for a lollypop,
I’ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and
the blackbirds.</p>
<div class='pbb'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='p2-Ch-XVIII' class='c013'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BLACKBIRDS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily Longears</span>, the rabbit gentleman,
came out of his hollow-stump bungalow
to take a walk in the woods one day.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope I may meet with an adventure,” he
said to himself, as he limped along on his red,
white and blue crutch, that Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, the muskrat lady, had gnawed for him
out of a corn-stalk.</p>

<p class='c011'>An adventure, you know, as I have told you
before, is something that happens to you. If
you find a stick of lollypop candy, that’s a nice
adventure. But, if you lose your penny down
a crack in the board walk, that’s an unpleasant
adventure; though it may turn out all right in
the end.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” went on Uncle Wiggily, sort of
twinkling his pink nose, thoughtful like, “I
hope I have a nice adventure, or, perhaps, even
a funny one, like sneezing, as, when Tommie
Tucker gave the barber the pinch of snuff.”</p>

<p class='c011'>That’s the story I told you last night, if you
will kindly remember.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Uncle Wiggily hopped along, over the
fields and through the woods, and pretty soon
he came to where Mother Goose lived, not far
from his own hollow-stump bungalow. Mother
Goose was looking up at the sky.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good morning! What are you looking
for?” asked the bunny uncle. “Are you looking
for signs of rain, or snow in the clouds?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, indeed,” laughed Mother Goose. “But
you know this is the first day of Spring, and the
little birds should begin to sing. I am looking
to see if the blackbirds are flying up from down
South, where they went to spend the Winter.
They always come back in the Spring, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said Uncle Wiggily. “But I do not
see any blackbirds coming,” and he, too, looked
up at the sky. It was blue—very blue and pretty—like
babies’ eyes. And there were little white
clouds in the sky, floating along like fairy ships.
But there were no blackbirds to be seen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope nothing has happened to them,” said
Mother Goose, sort of anxious like. “They
should be here now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I, too, hope they are all right,” Uncle Wiggily
said. “I am going for a walk, and if I see
the blackbirds, I will tell them to hurry, as you
are looking for them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll be very glad if you do that,” spoke
Mother Goose, and then she had to go next door
to see if Little Bo Peep had found her lost sheep.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once more Uncle Wiggily hopped along.
He looked on all sides of him, and up in the air,
hoping he might see the blackbirds, for then,
surely, it would be Spring, and Winter had
lasted all too long for the animal folk.</p>

<p class='c011'>But no birds could the bunny uncle see. On
and on he went, until, after a while, he came to
the palace where lived Old King Cole, the jolly
old soul. And, as Mr. Longears was wondering
whether or not to go in, and pay King Cole a
visit, he heard some one humming a verse that
went like this:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sing a song of sixpence,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>A pocket full of rye.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Four-and-twenty blackbirds,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Baked within a pie.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>When the pie was opened,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>The birds began to sing.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Wasn’t that a dainty dish</div>
      <div class='line in3'>To set before the King?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Uncle Wiggily stood still. He thought for a
moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder,” he said. “I wonder—four-and-twenty—blackbirds?
Mother Goose didn’t say
how many she was expecting, and these may be
the very same ones. I guess I’ll go in and see
about this.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Into the palace of Old King Cole went the
bunny uncle. He knew his way about very
well, for he had been there before. From the
kitchen came all sorts of the most delicious
smells, just like a pie baking.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, hello, Uncle Wiggily!” cried jolly
Old King Cole, as he saw the bunny uncle hopping
along. “Come in and sit down! How
are you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fine!” cried the bunny uncle. “Very fine,
indeed. And yourself?” he asked, politely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never felt better in my life. I am just going
to have a bit of lunch. Won’t you sit down
and help me enjoy it?” asked Old King Cole,
also politely. “You may have some carrots
with lettuce sauce on, or a bit of boiled lollypops
with ice cream cones sprinkled on the top.
Anything you wish!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is very good of you,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“But don’t go to any trouble on my account.
I’ll have whatever you are going to
have.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then it will be pie!” cried Old King Cole.
“I told the cook to have pie to-day, and I think
it is ready. I’ll ring the bell for it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ding-dong!” rang the bell. In came the
cook with a big pie on a dish. And the cook
began to hum:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sing a song of sixpence,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>A pocket full of rye.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Four-and-twenty blackbirds,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Baked within a pie.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“What’s that?” cried Old King Cole.
“Twenty-four blackbirds baked in my pie!
Why, how did that happen?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was this way,” said the cook. “You told
me to give you pie to-day. Well, I made all
ready for it, but, at the last minute, I had nothing
to put in the pie—no apples, no cherries, no
peaches—nothing at all. I did not know what
to do, but, all of a sudden, I looked out of the
window, and I saw two dozen blackbirds flying
along. ‘The very thing!’ said I to myself.
‘They’ll do for Old King Cole’s pie!’ I asked
them if they would mind getting in between the
upper and lower pie crusts, and they said no.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And did they?” asked the king, putting his
crown on sideways.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They did,” answered the cook. “Look!”
and he sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When the pie was opened,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>The birds began to sing.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Wasn’t that a dainty dish</div>
      <div class='line in3'>To set before the king?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Then, taking care not to hurt the feathered
singers, the cook cut open the pie. Surely
enough, out flew the blackbirds, singing as
sweetly as one could wish. Around and around
the palace they flew, singing, and Uncle Wiggily
cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, these must be the blackbirds Mother
Goose is looking for! Did you come up from
the South to tell us that Spring has come?” he
asked them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” answered the birds, “we did. But
first we wanted to snuggle up in the pie for the
king.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! Well, you did it all right!” laughed
Old King Cole. “But, now, I don’t need you
in my pie any longer, so fly away to Mother
Goose. Uncle Wiggily and I will eat cake, instead
of pie, to-day, since there is nothing between
the crusts to chew on.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So they ate cake, and the blackbirds, which
had only been put in the pie just after it came
from the oven, flew all about animal land, singing:
“Spring is here! Spring is here!”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the bunny gentleman had his adventure
after all, you see, and if the cake of soap doesn’t
slide over the bathroom floor, and bunk into
the wash rag, when it is cleaning its teeth, I’ll
tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the fat
man.</p>

  <h2 id='p2-Ch-XIX' class='c013'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE FAT MAN</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>A letter</span> for you, Uncle Wiggily,” said
Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady
housekeeper, as she went to the door of the hollow-stump
bungalow, when the bird postman
gave a whistle, and a tap of his bill, to let them
know that he had some mail.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A letter for me! Thats’s nice!” said the
bunny uncle. “Why, it’s an invitation to a
party—for you and me,” he went on to Nurse
Jane. “It’s from Jollie and Jillie Longtail, the
mice children. They want us to come to their
house,” and he read the invitation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shall you go?” asked Nurse Jane.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall,” answered Uncle Wiggily. “And
before I go I must practice that new ice cream
cone dance, where you stand on one ear and eat
a lollypop. You’ll go, of course, Nurse Jane.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I don’t know. I need a new dress,
and——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say no more about it!” cried Uncle Wiggily,
with a jolly laugh. “Here is some money.
Go down to the five and ten cent store and buy
the finest gold and diamond silk dress you can
find. I want you to look nice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Nurse Jane bought the new dress, which
had rows and rows of double plaited insertion
with fried egg tassels down the side, and Uncle
Wiggily practiced dancing for the party the
Longtail mice children were to have.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last the evening for the party came. Off
started Uncle Wiggily and Nurse Jane, talking
of the good times they were going to have, when,
all at once, the bunny gentleman cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! I’ve forgotten my dancing
shoes! I’ll run back to the bungalow after them.
You keep on, Nurse Jane, and I’ll soon catch up
to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily turned back, taking a shortcut
to the hollow-stump bungalow, where he
lived, and he was almost there when, all at once,
he heard some one crying sadly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! It’s gone! Oh, what shall I do?
I’d go after him if I could, but I can’t. Oh,
what trouble I’m in!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! Trouble!” cried the bunny uncle.
“Some one is in trouble! That’s what I like to
hear! I mean I like to hear it because I like to
help people out of trouble. I must see who
this is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked through the bushes and there, sitting
on a stump, in the moonlight, Uncle Wiggily
saw a very big man, with a turban—a white
cloth, like a twisted towel—around his head.
The man was sort of chocolate-colored.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, what is your trouble?” asked Uncle
Wiggily. “Perhaps I can help you. Who are
you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Surely you must have heard of me,” said the
big man, puffing out his chest. “I am in
Mother Goose’s book.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t seem to remember you,” said Uncle
Wiggily, sort of thoughtful like, scratching his
pink, twinkling nose with his ear. “If you
would kindly tell me——”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the troubled one sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I am the fat man from Bombay,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I was smoking my pipe one fine day.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>When a bird, called a snipe,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Flew away with my pipe.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Which vexed the fat man of Bombay.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“Oh, now I remember you,” said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m glad you do,” spoke the fat man. “So
you see how it is. I’m really quite vexed, which
means just a little angry, and I’m in trouble, for
the snipe bird did fly away with my pipe, and
I can’t smoke, and I must do that, or it won’t be
the way it is in the Mother Goose book. Do
you think you can help me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’ll try,” said Uncle Wiggily. “You
just wait here until I run to my hollow-stump
bungalow for my dancing slippers, and, when
I come back I’ll see what I can do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily hurried on through the woods,
found his dancing shoes, and was hurrying
back, when, all of a sudden, he slipped and fell
head over heels with his slippers, and a big sliver
was stuck in his paw.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” cried the bunny uncle. “That
sliver hurts very much! What shall I do? Now
I am in trouble, for I can’t dance and I can’t
help the fat man of Bombay. Oh, dear, what
can I do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily couldn’t hop on with that
sliver in his paw, and he couldn’t pull it out, try
as he did.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Help! Help!” he called, as loudly as he
could. “Will no one help me, and the fat man
of Bombay?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! Who is that calling?” asked a voice.
“And who knows about the fat man of Bombay?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do,” answered the bunny uncle. “I am
calling, and I know the Bombay fat man. He
is in trouble, too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then through the bushes came flying a bird
called a snipe, and in his bill he carried a pipe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, you have it!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“Why don’t you give it back to him so he won’t
be sad and vexed any more? Why don’t you
give back the pipe to the fat man of Bombay?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would, if I could find him,” answered the
snipe. “You see, I only took his pipe in fun.
He looked so funny sitting there smoking, that
I thought I’d play a trick on him. So I flew
away with his pipe, that’s because I’m a snipe.
But I’ll give it back to him now. Is there something
the matter with you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” answered Uncle Wiggily, sadly, “I
have run a big wooden splinter in my paw, and
I can’t get it out, and I want to go to the Longtail
dance and I can’t——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course you can!” cried the snipe bird, in
a jolly voice. “With my sharp bill I can easily
pull the splinter out of your paw. Let me get
hold of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Laying down the fat man’s pipe, the snipe
soon pulled the splinter out of Uncle Wiggily’s
paw.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now I can go to the dance!” cried the
bunny uncle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And if you will show me where the fat man
of Bombay is, I’ll take him back his pipe,” said
the snipe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This way!” cried Uncle Wiggily. He
showed the bird where the sad, fat man was sitting,
and the snipe gave back the pipe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, how good you are!” cried the fat man,
striking a match, but only in fun, of course.
“Now my troubles are over.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And so are mine—the sliver-trouble!” said
the bunny uncle. Then the fat man of Bombay,
which is in India, smoked his pipe, the snipe
flew away and Uncle Wiggily and Nurse Jane
went on to the dance and had a fine time.</p>

<p class='c011'>And if the top of the stairs doesn’t go sit at the
bottom, so the wax doll can’t get up to sleep in
the cat’s cradle, I’ll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and the tarts.</p>

  <h2 id='p2-Ch-XX' class='c013'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE TARTS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Where</span> are you going, Uncle Wiggily?”
asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat
lady, as she saw the rabbit gentleman starting
out of the hollow-stump bungalow one morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, just for a walk, over the fields and
through the woods,” he answered. “This is the
Spring of the year, now, you know, since the
four-and-twenty blackbirds jumped out of Old
King Cole’s pie, and I want to see if the grass
and flowers have begun to spring up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think it is a little early for them,” spoke
Nurse Jane.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I’ll go for a walk, anyhow,” said
Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>So the bunny uncle hopped on and on, sometimes
leaning on his red, white and blue-striped
barber-pole rheumatism crutch, that Nurse Jane
had gnawed for him out of a corn-stalk, and
again he would carry it under his paw.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pretty soon Uncle Wiggily came to the palace
where Old King Cole lived. He was thinking
of going inside, and perhaps playing a game of
checkers, as he used to do with Grandfather
Goosey Gander, when, all at once, the bunny
uncle saw a lady looking at him from the kitchen
window.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lady had on a silk dress, all spangled over
with red hearts, like a valentine. And on her
head was a cap, and that had blue hearts on, so
she looked very pretty indeed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How do you do?” asked the lady of Uncle
Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well,” he answered. “And how are
you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, not well at all,” was the answer, and
the lady sighed sadly. “Oh, there is so much
trouble here!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Trouble? Trouble?” asked Uncle Wiggily.
“Why, then I came to just the right
place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How is that?” asked the lady, sort of surprised
like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because I always try to help trouble, or
those who are in it. Let me see now, I don’t believe
I have the pleasure of knowing you,” and
Uncle Wiggily sort of made his nose twinkle
inquisitive like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, you must have heard about me,” said
the lady, with a smile. “I’m in Mother Goose’s
book, you know. Listen to this:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>All on a summer’s day.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The Jack of Hearts, he took those tarts,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And with them ran away.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“I am the Queen of Hearts,” said the lady,
bowing politely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pleased to meet you,” spoke Uncle Wiggily,
also with a low bow. “So that is the
trouble, eh? The Jack of Hearts has taken the
tarts away?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, no, not exactly,” answered the Heart
Queen. “You see, I haven’t yet made the tarts.
But, when I do, I suppose the Jack will take
them, and then there’ll be trouble, for Old King
Cole specially wants them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why haven’t you yet made them?” asked
the bunny uncle. “If it says in the Mother
Goose book that you must make the tarts, why
don’t you make them?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because, in the first place,” answered the
Queen of Hearts, sort of shivering like, “this
isn’t a Summer day. And, in the second place,
I don’t know how to make the tarts—that’s the
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, that is easily mended,” spoke the
bunny uncle. “I can’t make a Summer day out
of a Spring one, but I can show you how to make
tarts.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, can you—and will you?” asked the
Queen of Hearts, clapping her hands in delight.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can and will,” said Uncle Wiggily, kindly.
“I have often watched Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, my muskrat lady bungalow-keeper,
make them, so I ought to know how.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell me,” said the Queen, “and we’ll do it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You take flour and water and milk and
sugar and a yeast cake and spices and make a pie
crust,” said the bunny uncle. “Then you bake
it in the oven after you have cut it out in little
round pieces, some with three holes in, and some
just plain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, how lovely that sounds!” cried the
Queen, clapping her hands again. “I have all
the things you need. Let’s make the tarts.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And when the crust is baked in the oven,”
went on Mr. Longears, “you take out two pieces
of tarts, put jam in between them, press them
together, and—there you are.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lovelier and more lovely!” cried the
Queen. “Oh, I am so glad you happened to
come along. Now we’ll begin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So she and Uncle Wiggily mixed up the sugar
and spice, and other things nice, making the
pie crust, out of which they cut round, flat
pieces, some with three holes in, and some plain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, what lovely tarts they’ll be!” laughed
the Queen. “Isn’t it a shame that the Jack of
Hearts must take them away?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, if it’s that way in the Mother Goose
book, it can’t be helped,” said Uncle Wiggily.
“But when he takes these tarts we’ll make some
more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the tarts were made and set aside to cool.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now we’ll hide behind the kitchen door,”
said the Queen of Hearts, “and watch the Jack
as he comes in to get them. I hope he doesn’t
take them all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maybe he won’t,” said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pretty soon, as the bunny gentleman and the
Queen of Hearts were hiding, into the kitchen
came the Jack of Hearts. He was a funny chap,
with little candy hearts all over his clothes and
cap.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, ha!” said the Jack, smacking his lips.
“This is tart day. Here is where I have a fine
feast! I’ll get the tarts of the Queen of Hearts.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Laughing to himself, the Jack went up to the
shelf where the tarts were cooling. He lifted
one down, and took a big bite from it, saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll taste them before I take them away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But, no sooner had he tasted it than the Jack
of Hearts he dropped that tart and, all excited
like, he cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh me! Oh my! Oh ice water and lemonade!
Oh, how my mouth burns! I don’t want
any of those tarts! Oh, no,” and away he ran,
not taking one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, that’s queer,” said the queen. “He
should have taken those hearts. That’s the way
it is in the book.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The bunny uncle looked at the tarts he and the
Queen had made. He took a little taste of one,
and then Uncle Wiggily said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“No wonder the Jack didn’t want them. By
mistake we have put red pepper in the tarts instead
of red raspberry jam! They’re as hot as
a stove. Oh dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind,” said the Queen, sweetly.
“We’ll make some more tarts, and this time
we’ll do it right and put in the jam. Anyhow
I’m glad, for now the Jack won’t want to take
the new tarts I make.” And the Jack did not.
He had had enough.</p>

<p class='c011'>So the tarts were made over again by Uncle
Wiggily and the Queen—right, this time, with
real jam—and King Cole ate them and said they
were fine. And if the paper boy doesn’t turn
into a bottle of ink, and make the fountain pen
go swimming with the goldfish, I’ll tell you next
about Uncle Wiggily and the jumping cow.</p>

  <h2 id='p2-Ch-XXI' class='c013'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE JUMPING COW</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily Longears</span>, the nice, old gentleman
rabbit, started out from his hollow-stump
bungalow one day, to take a walk. He hopped
over the fields and through the woods, wondering
whether or not he might meet with an
adventure, when, after a little while, he came
to the House that Jack Built.</p>

<p class='c011'>And there, nicely wrapped up in a bag, the
bunny uncle saw the malt that lay in the House
that Jack Built. Malt, you know, is a sort
of flour, out of which they make buckwheat
cakes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My goodness!” exclaimed Uncle Wiggily,
as he scratched his pink, twinkling nose, “I did
not think I had come this far.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He stood in front of the House that Jack
Built, wondering whether or not he ought not
go in and say “howdy do,” when he saw coming
out of the house the rat that ate the malt, and the
cat that caught the rat, and the dog that worried
the cat that caught the rat that ate the malt that
lay in the House that Jack Built.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, this is very strange,” said Uncle Wiggily
to himself. “They all seem to be running
away!” And indeed they were. For the cat
was chasing the rat and the dog was chasing
the cat and the rat was chasing after its own
shadow, so as to get away from the cat, and then,
all of a sudden, out came Mother Goose herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, have you seen her, Uncle Wiggily?”
asked Mother Goose. “I am so worried about
her!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Seen whom? About whom are you
worried?” asked the rabbit gentleman, politely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The jumping cow,” answered Mother
Goose. “She’s gone!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess you mean the cow with the crumpled
horn, don’t you?” asked the bunny uncle.
“She’s the one, you know, that tossed the dog
that worried the cat that caught the rat that
ate the malt that lay in the House that Jack
Built.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I don’t mean that cow,” answered
Mother Goose. “I mean the jumping cow.
She’s the worst cow for jumping you ever saw.
She jumps over all the fences and stone walls
and when we want her to give some milk for
Little Tommie Tucker’s supper she isn’t to be
found. I’ve looked everywhere for her, but I
can’t find her. Oh, dear! Such trouble! I
thought she might be here, in the House that
Jack Built, with the Crumpled-Horn Cow.
But she isn’t.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! Just you leave it to me, if you please,”
said Uncle Wiggily, kindly. “I’ll find the
jumping cow for you. I can start off in my
automobile, with the bologna sausage tires,
that go faster when you sprinkle pepper on them
or in my clothes-basket airship, with toy circus
balloons on the handles.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You had better take your airship,” said
Mother Goose. “A jumping cow would be
found up in the air, I think.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think so myself,” said Uncle Wiggily.
So he hurried back to the hollow-stump bungalow
and got out his airship. In that he sailed
over the woods and fields, looking for the jumping
cow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do, please, ask her to hurry back,” said
Mother Goose. “For she has all the milk
for supper, and Tommie Tucker and the
Children of the Old Woman who Lives in a
Shoe, are so hungry they don’t know what to
do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll get her,” promised Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>On and on he sailed in his airship. But he
could not see the jumping cow. Up high he
sailed and down low, and finally, when he came
close to the ground, near the place where Sammie
Littletail, the boy rabbit, lived with his sister
Susie and his father and mother, Uncle Wiggily
heard Jollie Longtail, the mouse boy, singing
a song that went like this:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hi-diddle-diddle!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The cat’s in the fiddle!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The cow jumped over the moon,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The little dog laughed</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To see so much sport,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And the dish ran away with the spoon.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“Hello, what’s that!” cried Uncle Wiggily,
bringing his airship to a sudden stop and sailing
down to earth. “What cow is that Jollie, that
jumped over the moon?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Mother Goose’s cow,” answered the
little mouse boy. “You see, Joie Kat, the little
kitten boy, crawled inside the fiddle, having a
game of tag with Tommie, his brother. And
when Jack Sprat tried to play music on the
fiddle it made such a funny noise that the cow,
who was waiting for Little Boy Blue to blow his
horn, gave a big jump, and away up over the
moon she went. That’s the way it was,” said
Jollie Longtail.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I see,” answered Uncle Wiggily. “Well,
in that case, I suppose I must go sailing up to
the moon to find the jumping cow. She is
needed to bring home the milk for Little Tommie
Tucker’s supper.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then along came Mother Goose once
more.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, look!” she cried, pointing her broom
up to the sky. “There’s my nice jumping cow
now. She’s falling down from her jump over
the moon. Oh, she’ll break her horns, surely.
Oh, dear! What shall I do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do? Do nothing,” said Uncle Wiggily,
kindly. “I will do it myself. See, I have my
airship. I’ll sail up and catch the jumping cow
before she has time to fall. Then everything
will be all right.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, please do!” begged Mother Goose.</p>

<p class='c011'>Up in his clothes-basket airship went Uncle
Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman.</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in23'>up.</div>
      <div class='line in21'>and</div>
      <div class='line in19'>up</div>
      <div class='line in17'>and</div>
      <div class='line in15'>up</div>
      <div class='line'>The cow was falling</div>
      <div class='line in15'>down</div>
      <div class='line in17'>and</div>
      <div class='line in19'>down</div>
      <div class='line in21'>and</div>
      <div class='line in23'>down.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” cried Mother Goose, on the
earth below. “That cow should have known
better than to jump over the moon!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think so myself,” said the Man in the
Moon. “I tried to stop her, but I couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind,” said Uncle Wiggily. “It
will be all right, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he steered his airship right under the
falling cow, who was no longer jumping. Instead,
she was sailing toward the earth, with a
piece of green cheese on one horn. She really
had jumped over the moon, but she slipped, and
that’s how the green cheese got on the tip of her
horn.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here you are!” cried Uncle Wiggily, in
his jolly voice, just like a trolley car conductor.
“Plenty of room up in front.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then the jumping cow landed gently in the
rabbit gentleman’s airship, and he brought her
down to earth as lightly as a feather, and the cow
was just in time with the milk for Little Tommie
Tucker’s supper.</p>

<p class='c011'>So this teaches you that Uncle Wiggily can
do many things besides eating carrots and having
the rheumatism, and if the egg beater
doesn’t skip out to whip the rag doll’s carpets,
to earn five cents for the moving pictures, I’ll
tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the pussies.</p>

</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily Longears</span>, the kind old rabbit
gentleman, was hopping along in the woods
in front of his hollow-stump bungalow one
morning, and, every now and then, he would
stoop over and look at the ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are you doing, Wiggy, if I may ask?”
inquired Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat
lady, who kept the bungalow nice and neat
for the bunny uncle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You may ask, and I will tell you,” politely
answered Mr. Longears. “I am looking to see
if any flowers are growing in the woods.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What! Flowers growing this time of
year?” cried Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy. “It is much
too early!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, it was the first of Spring, the other
day!” said Uncle Wiggily. “I should think the
flowers would be waking up now, and putting
their heads out from beneath the brown earth-blankets,
under which they slept all winter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no!” laughed Nurse Jane. “First we
must have some April showers to bring May
flowers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I am going to keep on looking,” said
Uncle Wiggily. “I may find a flower in the
woods, or, if I do not, I’ll have an adventure.
Either one would be nice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So away hopped the bunny uncle, leaning on
his red, white and blue barber-pole striped rheumatism
crutch, which Nurse Jane had nicely
speckled with pink candy for him on account
of Spring coming.</p>

<p class='c011'>And, all of a sudden, as Mr. Longears went
along, he slipped in a little puddle of water,
and—presto-chango! Off flew his glasses and
they were broken all to pieces.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear!” cried Uncle Wiggily, picking
up the bits. “That’s too bad. Now I can
hardly see to get along. I must take these glasses
to the blacksmith shop to have them mended.
I hope I don’t lose my way, for, without my
glasses, I am almost as blind as a bat or an owl
in daylight. But I will do the best I can.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With the pieces of his broken glasses in his
pocket, Uncle Wiggily went along through the
woods. He peered this way and that, for the
sun hurt his eyes when he had no glasses, but
still he could see a little bit. Then, all at once,
Uncle Wiggily, looking through the trees, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, here comes Mrs. Wibblewobble,
the duck lady, I do declare!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily made his necktie tidy and
smooth, and pulled down his vest, for he wanted
to look nice. Then he made a low bow and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“How do you do, Mrs. Wibblewobble? I
am glad to meet you in the woods.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But there was no answer, and Uncle Wiggily
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, I wonder if she heard me? I hope
Mrs. Wibblewobble isn’t getting deaf! I must
speak louder.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked again where he thought he had
seen the duck lady, going a little nearer, and, lo!
it was only a stump that looked like Mrs. Wibblewobble.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, well!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “I
can’t see at all well without my glasses. What a
mistake to make!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He laughed and walked on, and, pretty soon
he thought he saw Mrs. Stubtail, the lady bear,
mother to Neddie and Beckie Stubtail.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, how do you——” began Uncle Wiggily,
and then he saw it was only a big black
stone on the woodland path.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! Another mistake!” cried the bunny
uncle, with a laugh. “I am making lots of them
to-day. It comes of having such poor eye-sight!”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he went on toward the blacksmith shop to
have his glasses mended. A little later he
thought a fallen log was Grandfather Goosey
Gander, and, not long after that, he saw a pile of
dried leaves and thought they were Uncle Butter,
the goat gentleman. He was just going to
shake paws with the leaves, when he came closer
he saw that he had made another mistake.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, well!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “It
certainly is too bad not to have your glasses once
you start wearing them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>On he went, a little farther, and he came soon
to a place where some bushes were growing.
Up in the bushes a little way from the ground,
Uncle Wiggily saw some soft, furry, fuzzy
things perched on the branches.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, the dear little pussies!” cried the rabbit
gentleman. “Some dog must have come along
here and chased them up in the bushes. I’ll get
them down. Don’t be afraid, little ones,” he
said. “I won’t let anybody harm you. Come to
your Uncle Wiggily!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The bunny uncle hopped up and held out his
paw to the fuzzy things. They did not speak to
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But that’s all right,” he said. “They are
too frightened even to mew. I’ll take them to
Mother Goose and she will give them some
warm milk. Come along, Pussies!” said the
rabbit gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, though he went close to the bush, and
called very gently, the pussies did not jump into
his paws.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess they are too frightened,” said the
bunny uncle. “I’ll just break off the branch
with the pussies on,” thought Mr. Longears,
“and carry them home that way. Poor little
pussies! Did a bad bow-wow dog scare you?
Well, just come with your Uncle Wiggily, and
it will be all right!”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the bunny gentleman broke off the branch
with the soft, fuzzy pussies on it, and away he
walked through the woods.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll take them to Mother Goose,” he said,
“and then I’ll go to the blacksmith shop and
have my glasses mended.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily soon was at the house of the
lady who swept cobwebs out of the sky.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mother Goose! Mother Goose!” he cried.
“I’ve brought you some little pussies on the
branch of a bush. A dog chased and scared
them up there, and they were afraid to come
down. Please get them some warm milk with
carrot sauce in.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mother Goose came running to the door.
She looked at the fuzzy things Uncle Wiggily
held out. Then she laughed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s the matter?” asked the bunny uncle.
“Why don’t you take care of the poor
pussies?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pussies? Pussies?” laughed dear old
Mother Goose, harder than before. “Those
are pussy willows.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pussy willows” said Uncle Wiggily, surprised
like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, they are the soft, fuzzy blossoms of the
willow bush. They are plants and not an animal
at all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, well!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “That
shows what it is to be without glasses. I certainly
thought they were real pussies. I must
hurry to the blacksmith’s to have my glasses
fixed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he did, and his glasses were soon mended;
while Mother Goose put the pussy willows in
water where they would blossom out into big
cat-posies.</p>

<p class='c011'>And if the stepladder doesn’t walk off with
the cake of soap and have a birthday party for
the broom and dust pan on the back stoop, I’ll
tell you next about Uncle Wiggily and the
leaves.</p>

  <h2 id='p2-Ch-XXIII' class='c013'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE LEAVES</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily Longears</span>, the rabbit gentleman,
stood out in front of his hollow-stump
bungalow in the woods, one day, and looked
carefully around. Then he glanced up at the
blue sky.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the matter?” asked Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat lady bungalow-keeper.
“Are you looking for some one?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, no, not exactly,” replied the bunny
uncle, slowly. “I was just thinking that perhaps
I had better begin to do some Spring cleaning
around my bungalow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Spring cleaning! Do you mean inside or
outside?” asked the muskrat lady, as she carefully
wiped a bit of flour off the end of her
nose with her tail, for she had been baking a
cake.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I mean outside, of course,” replied
Uncle Wiggily. “I’ll leave you to look after
the bungalow, inside, while I clean up outside.
You see there are so many last year’s dried leaves
about, here in the woods, that if they were to
catch fire our bungalow might burn.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mercy!” cried Nurse Jane. “I wouldn’t
want that to happen. Oh, my!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, indeed,” Uncle Wiggily said. “Once
was enough. The last time we had a fire you
and I had to board around with our friends.
Still, it was not so bad as it might have been, for
I met Mother Goose, and did some favors for
her and her friends.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What were you thinking of doing to the
leaves?” asked Nurse Jane, curious like and inquisitive.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, I thought I’d rake them up in a pile
and make a soft place, so if Sammie and Susie
Littletail, the rabbit children, came along on
their way home from school, they could jump on
the leaves as they sometimes do in the hay.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very good,” Nurse Jane said. “You rake
up the leaves and I’ll wash the dishes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Uncle Wiggily began. For a rake he
used the dried branch from a tree. It had many
little ends to it, almost like the teeth of a rake,
that branch had.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder if a rake ever gets the toothache?”
thought Uncle Wiggily, as he pulled and poked
the leaves into piles. “If it does, it must hurt
very much because there are so many teeth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the bunny uncle did not have a real rake,
only a tree branch, which he used as one, and
that had no teeth to ache, I’m glad to say.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It will be good to get the layers of dead,
dried leaves off the ground,” said Uncle Wiggily,
“for soon the April showers will bring the
May flowers, and they find it easier to spring up
if there is no blanket of leaves over them to hold
them down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The bunny uncle soon had many piles of soft,
dried leaves, and in a little while along came
Sammie and Susie Littletail, the rabbit children,
and into the leaves they jumped, off a stump,
bouncing up and down like rubber balls.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pretty soon Uncle Wiggily heard a voice saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear, isn’t it too bad? Yes, it’s even
three, four, five, six, seven bad! That’s what it
is!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! Some one in trouble!” said Uncle
Wiggily, dropping his tree-branch rake and
running back to the pile of leaves. “I suppose
either Sammie or Susie has fallen down, and
bumped one of their noses. I must help them
up!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But when Uncle Wiggily got there the cupboard
was bare—oh, no, excuse me, if you
please. That’s in another story. I mean when
the bunny uncle reached the pile of leaves where
Sammie and Susie had been playing neither one
of the rabbit children was in sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, my!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “They
must be all covered up with the leaves! I’ll have
to dig them out! No wonder it’s two, six, seven
bad! Poor rabbits under the leaves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With his paws he began digging at the piles
of leaves, scattering them all over, after his hard
work of raking them up. But as he went deeper
and deeper he could see no signs of the bunny
children. And then, from somewhere behind
him, Uncle Wiggily heard the sad voice again
saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! It’s too bad! Yes, it’s two, three
and even sixteen-eleven bad. Oh, dear!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Turning quickly, Uncle Wiggily saw Jimmie
Wibblewobble, the boy duck, with an empty bag
over his wing shoulder.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Jimmie! Is that you?” asked the
bunny uncle, in surprise. “I thought it was
Sammie and Susie Littletail. They were playing
in these dried leaves a while ago, but now I
can’t find them, and I fear they may be
covered up so far down that I can never get them
out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, don’t worry about that, Uncle Wiggily,”
said Jimmie, the boy duck. “Sammie
and Susie are all right. I met them running
down a woodland path a little while ago, as I
came along, and they were talking of what fun
they had had in the leaves. They got tired and
ran away when you weren’t looking. That’s
why you can’t find them under the leaves. But,
oh, dear! Two, sixteen-eleven bad!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, what’s the matter with <i>you</i>?” asked
Uncle Wiggily, kindly. “Are <i>you</i> in trouble,
Jimmie?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am, Uncle Wiggily.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What kind of trouble, Jimmie, my duck
boy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Feather-trouble,” answered the Wibblewobble
chap.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Feather-trouble?” repeated Uncle Wiggily,
sort of surprised like and astonished. “Feather-trouble?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes. You see my mother sent me with a bag
of our best duck feathers for Mother Goose to
make a feather bed from. Well, all at once,
some strong March wind came dancing by,
turned the bag inside out and blew away every
feather! And, what to do I don’t know, for
there are no more feathers at our coop. And if
Mother Goose doesn’t have feathers for her bed
she will feel badly. Oh, dear! Such trouble!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily thought for a moment. Then
he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ho, Jimmie! I see a way out of your
trouble. Fill your bag with some of these soft,
dried leaves. They will be nearly as good as
feathers for Mother Goose, and, at the same
time, you will be doing me a favor by taking
away the leaves, so the flowers can grow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, fine!” cried Jimmie. So he took a big
bag of the leaves, which Mother Goose said
were as good to sleep on as feathers, and thus
everything came out just right, you see, and
Sammie and Susie weren’t lost under the leaves
after all, for which Uncle Wiggily was very
glad.</p>

<p class='c011'>And if the fried egg doesn’t try to hide in the
apple dumpling and make the peach stone jump
over the shortcake, when we have company for
supper, I’ll tell you next about Uncle Wiggily
and the wise man.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='p2-Ch-XXIV' class='c013'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE WISE MAN</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Rat-a-tat-tat</span>!” came a knock on the door
of the hollow-stump bungalow, where Uncle
Wiggily Longears, the rabbit gentleman, lived.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll see who it is,” he called to Nurse Jane
Fuzzy Wuzzy and the muskrat lady housekeeper
was glad of that, for her paws were in
the dishwater up to her elbows, and you know
how it is yourself; you don’t like to answer the
bell with your hands all soap bubbles, like a
pipe.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Uncle Wiggily went to the door, and,
standing there, he saw Nannie Wagtail, the little
goat girl. And there were tears in Nannie’s
eyes, and she was trying to wipe them away with
the tips of her horns. But when she did this she
only tickled herself and she had to laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she didn’t want to laugh; she wanted to
cry, for she was sad. And you know how it is
yourself—you can’t laugh and cry at the same
time; can you?</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Nannie! What is the matter?” asked
Uncle Wiggily, kindly. “Come in and tell me
all your troubles!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! Boo hoo! Hoo boo! I have lots
of troubles!” said the little goat girl. “My best
doll, Priscilla Spicecake Orangejuice, is gone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gone!” cried Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Taken!” exclaimed Nannie. “I was out
in front of our house a while ago playing dolls
with Beckie Stubtail, the little girl bear. Beckie
had her doll, Esmeralda Pancake Eggturner,
with her, and we were having a lovely time.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I laid my doll down to go in the house to
get some cookies, and when I came out my doll
was gone, and Beckie was crying.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, what happened?” asked Uncle Wiggily,
surprised like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Beckie said a man came running along,
grabbed up my doll, and before she could stop
him he hurried off into the woods with my dear
Priscilla Spicecake Orangejuice!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, that’s too bad!” said the bunny uncle.
“Now don’t you cry any more. You just tell me
what sort of a man he was who took your doll
and I’ll go after him and make him give it back,
even if I have to get the circus elephant to squirt
water on him from the lemonade barrel. Tell
me what sort of a man he was.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was a man who wore glasses,” said
Nannie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Say no more!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “I
think I know exactly who he is! I’ll go after
him at once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the bunny uncle, telling Nurse Jane not to
wait lunch for him, started off over the fields and
through the woods to look for Nannie’s doll.
On the way he met Mother Goose, and he asked
that old lady:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are any of your friends the kind of a man
who wears glasses, and would take a little goat
girl’s doll?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, yes,” said Mother Goose, slowly, “the
Wise Man might. You see he spoiled his eyes,
reading so much to make him wise, that he has
to wear glasses. But he is really very kind. I
think he only took Nannie’s doll for a joke, or
perhaps he wants to get her another just like it
and took that along for a sample.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps,” said Uncle Wiggily. “But, anyhow,
I’ll find him and ask him about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he walked and hopped on and on through
the woods to where the Wise Man used to live,
and pretty soon, from behind a big bush, the
bunny uncle heard some one singing this
song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There was a man in our town,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>And he was wondrous wise.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>He jumped into a berry bush,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>And scratched out both his eyes.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>But when he saw his eyes were out,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>With all his might and main,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>He jumped into another bush</div>
      <div class='line in3'>And scratched them in again.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“Ha!” said Uncle Wiggily softly. “I
thought so! The wise man! I have found him!
Now to see if he has Nannie’s doll!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily peeked through the bush,
which was a blackberry one, only there were no
berries on it now. On the other side, sitting on
the ground, was the Wise Man, wearing glasses,
and he had Nannie’s doll in his hands. He was
talking to the doll, something like this:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, little doll, don’t be afraid. I won’t
hurt you. I’m just going to toss you into the
berry bush, and scratch out both your eyes. But
that won’t hurt, for as soon as I see your eyes are
out, with all my might and main, I’ll toss you in
another bush and scratch them in again. There
you go!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Before Uncle Wiggily could stop him, the
Wise Man had tossed Nannie’s doll, Priscilla
Spicecake Orangejuice, into the berry bush.
Then the man cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, your eyes are scratched out, all right,
dollie! Now to scratch them in again!” And,
before Uncle Wiggily could hop any closer to
stop him, the Wise Man tossed again into the
bush, the poor doll. And when she fell down
the Wise Man carefully picked her up, and,
looking at her, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alas! Alack a-day! Woe is me! The
eyes aren’t scratched in again at all! Oh, dear,
what shall I do? I’ll have to get the little goat
girl another doll.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily jumped out from behind the
berry bush.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you mean?” asked the bunny
uncle. “Why do you treat a poor doll so?
Look, her hair has come off, and her eyes have
fallen out! Oh, my!” and from the ground he
picked up the doll’s hair-wig and eyes, which
were of glass, fastened together with wire.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m sorry,” said the Wise Man. “I’m very
sorry this has happened. But I read about the
Wise Man in the Mother Goose book, who
jumped into a berry bush and got a new pair of
eyes. I thought I could do the same as he, for
I’m tired of glasses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I thought I’d try it on a doll first, to see
if it were true. So, not having any doll of my
own I took Nannie’s, meaning no harm. But
see what I have done!” he said, sadly. “I have
scratched out her eyes and her wig is off, and I
can’t put the eyes back again, nor yet the wig.
It’s a good thing I didn’t jump into the scratchy
bush myself. It is better to wear glasses than
have no eyes at all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, indeed,” said Uncle Wiggily, and he
felt sorry for the poor Wise Man. “But never
mind,” went on the bunny uncle. “I know a
monkey-doodle gentleman, who mends broken
dolls. I’ll take Priscilla Spicecake Orangejuice
to him, and he can fasten her eyes in again and
glue on her wig.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you? Then please do!” said the Wise
Man. “I’ll pay the monkey-doodle, and here is
five cents extra for little Nannie. Tell her I’m
sorry I borrowed her doll and I’ll never do it
again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right,” cheerfully said Uncle Wiggily,
“and don’t you try to scratch your eyes out, and
in again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I won’t,” promised the Wise Man.
“Glasses are good enough for me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The monkey-doodle gentleman soon fixed
Nannie’s doll as good as ever, so the eyes opened
and shut, and the little goat girl was happy once
more, when Uncle Wiggily brought back Priscilla
Spicecake Orangejuice. Thus, you see,
everything came out all right, as I generally try
to make it.</p>

<p class='c011'>And if the crazy quilt doesn’t jump into the
rag bag and get lost so the pillow case has no
place to sleep, when it comes home from the
moving pictures, I’ll tell you next about Uncle
Wiggily and the tailors.</p>

</div>
<p class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Well</span>, where are you going this morning,
Uncle Wiggily?” asked Nurse Jane Fuzzy
Wuzzy, the muskrat lady, of the rabbit gentleman,
as he lifted his red, white and blue-striped
rheumatism crutch down off the hat rack, and
opened the front door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’m just going out for a hop through
the woods,” replied the bunny uncle. “Mother
Goose said that Grandfather Goosey Gander
was coming to pay her a visit to-day, and, as I
haven’t seen him in some time, I thought I’d go
over myself and have a little talk.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well,” went on Nurse Jane, “and on
your way back I wish you would bring me a
spool of thread.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A spool of thread? Why, certainly,” promised
Uncle Wiggily, and off he hopped through
the woods until he came to where Mother Goose
lived. Her house was next door to the shoe, in
which lived the Old Woman Who Had So Many
Children She Didn’t Know What To Do.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good morning, Mother Goose,” said Uncle
Wiggily, politely. “I hope I see you well. Has
Grandpa Goosey Gander come yet?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not yet. I am expecting him every minute.
Sit down and make yourself at home,” and
Mother Goose dusted a chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily sat down, and he and Mother
Goose were talking about the best way to give
the most bread and jam to animal children, when
along came Grandpa Goosey.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m sorry I’m late,” he said, all sort of flustered
like, “but I lost a button off my coat. I
stopped in a tailor’s to have it sewed on, but,
would you believe me? There isn’t a tailor to
be found in Woodland—not one in this whole
forest!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nonsense!” cried Mother Goose. “Why,
there are four-and-twenty tailors here—just as
many as there were blackbirds baked in the pie
that was set before the king. No tailors to be
found out of all those four-and-twenty? Nonsense!
There must be!” and she swept cobwebs
down out of the sky just for fun.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not a tailor!” said Grandpa Goosey. “I
looked all over for one. Their shops were open,
but the tailors were gone, and so I had to come
without a button on my coat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind,” said Mother Goose. “I’ll
sew it on for you,” and she did.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That reminds me,” said Uncle Wiggily,
after they had talked a bit. “Speaking of tailors,
I’m to bring Nurse Jane a spool of thread.
I think I’ll be hopping along. If I can’t find any
tailor in his shop, where I can buy the thread,
I’ll have to go to the five and ten cent store.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So he said good-by to Mother Goose and
Grandpa Gander, and away hopped the bunny
uncle gentleman over the fields and through the
woods.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder if I could find those four-and-twenty
tailors?” thought Uncle Wiggily.
“Four-and-twenty—that’s just two dozen—quite
a number. I wonder why they all left their
shops? I wonder——?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And just then from behind some bushes he
heard some voices saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You go up and jab her!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, you do it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m afraid!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, so am I. Hi there, who has a yardstick?
Let whoever has a yardstick go up and
jab her!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And let some one tickle her with a needle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You do it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, you. I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, so am I! Boo!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Goodness me gracious sakes alive and some
hooks and eyes!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “What
does all this mean? Who’s afraid?” He
peeked through the bushes and there he saw, on
the woodland path, a lot of men with needles,
pins, spools of thread, tape measures, yardsticks,
thimbles, scissors, linings, pockets, buttonholes
and all things like that.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who are you?” asked Uncle Wiggily, in
surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll tell you who we are,” answered one of
the twenty-four, (for there were just two dozen
of them) as the rabbit gentleman could count.
Then some one sang this song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We four-and-twenty tailors went to catch a snail,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The best man among us dared not touch her tail;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>She put out her horns like a little Kylow cow,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>So run, tailors! Run! Or she’ll bite us all just now!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>And as the tailor said that he turned and ran
through the woods as fast as ever he could run,
all the other twenty-three running after him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, my! Oh, me! Oh, dear! This is too
funny!” cried Uncle Wiggily. “Four-and-twenty
tailors afraid of a snail, even if she did
put out her horns like a Kylow cow. I say, tailors!
Come back! Come back!” cried Uncle
Wiggily. “Mother Goose is worried about
you. Come back!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’re afraid of the snail!” said one, who
had sung the song.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nonsense!” laughed Uncle Wiggily. “She
wouldn’t hurt a lightning bug! Come here, I’ll
show you how to make her pull in her horns!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Slowly and carefully the four-and-twenty tailors
came back on their tippy-tiptoes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What did you want to catch a snail for, anyhow?”
asked the bunny uncle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Make her put in her horns so she won’t look
so much like a cow and scare us, and we’ll tell
you,” said the singing tailor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily laughed and suddenly cried:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Snail, snail, pull in your horn,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Here’s Jimmie, the duck boy,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Looking for corn!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Then the snail quickly pulled in her horns
and crawled away and she didn’t hurt the tailors
any, and they didn’t tickle her with a needle,
thimble or even a spool of hooks and eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We just wanted to see if we could catch a
snail,” said the singing tailor. “We didn’t
mean to hurt her, but it says in Mother Goose’s
book that four-and-twenty tailors went out to
catch a snail, and, as we were not very busy this
morning, we went out. But, oh! how fierce she
did look with her horns! I’m not going snail-hunting
any more.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nor I,” cried the other twenty-three tailors
in a chorus. Then they thanked Uncle Wiggily
for having driven the snail away, as he did, by
making believe Jimmie Wibblewobble, the duck
boy, was coming after her (since ducks like
snails very much). And the tailors each gave
Uncle Wiggily a spool of thread, so Nurse Jane
had all she wanted, and Grandpa Goosey’s button
was sewed on.</p>

<p class='c011'>And if the basket of soap bubbles doesn’t fall
down-stairs and spill ink on the white table cloth
just as it is going to the dance, I’ll tell you next
about Uncle Wiggily and the bat.</p>

  <h2 id='p2-Ch-XXVI' class='c013'>CHAPTER XXVI<br /> <br /><span class='c018'>UNCLE WIGGILY AND THE BAT</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c019'><span class='sc'>Uncle Wiggily Longears</span>, the nice little boy
bear—Oh, please be so kind as to excuse me, as
the telephone girl says when she rings the dinner
bell at supper time. I mean Uncle Wiggily
Longears, the nice old rabbit gentleman, put on
his red, white and blue-striped rheumatism tall
silk hat and——</p>

<p class='c011'>Eh? What’s that? Something else wrong?
Oh, yes; to be sure. I meant to say he took his
red, white and blue-striped rheumatism crutch,
and put his tall silk hat on over his ears, and then
he started out of his hollow-stump bungalow for
a walk.</p>

<p class='c011'>I don’t know what’s the matter with me in this
story—making so many mistakes—unless it was
that I danced the fox-trot backward the other
night, and it turned out to be a goose-walk.
Anyhow, I’ll try to be more careful after this.</p>

<p class='c011'>Out stepped Uncle Wiggily, starting off toward
the woods, but he had not gone very far before
Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy, the muskrat
lady, called to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where are you going, Uncle Wiggily?
Don’t you know that it is after supper, and will
soon be dark? Then why do you go to the
woods?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want an adventure,” answered the bunny
uncle. “I haven’t had one to-day. And, as for
the dark, the moon will soon be up, and give me
good light. Have no fear, Nurse Jane, I will
soon be back safely.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Nurse Jane had no fear and Uncle Wiggily
hopped on and on, over the fields and
through the woods. All of a sudden he passed
the house where Susie Littletail, the little rabbit
girl, lived.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Uncle Wiggily,” called Mrs. Littletail,
the bunny mother. “If you see Susie, will you
please tell her to come home at once? Her supper
is quite cold, though I will warm up the carrot
gravy for her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll tell her,” promised the bunny uncle.
“Where is she?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She went over to play with Lulu and Alice
Wibblewobble, the two duck girls,” was the answer,
“and she must be having a fine time, for
she’s been there ever so long.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder what sort of an adventure I shall
have this evening,” thought the bunny uncle.
“Yesterday I drove away the snail that was scaring
the four-and-twenty tailors, but no tailors
would be out now, after dark. However, the
moon will soon be up, and then I will have light
enough to see an adventure if one happens
along.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Going a little farther, Uncle Wiggily came to
where Lulu and Alice Wibblewobble, the duck
girls, lived in a nice pen, with their father and
mother and their brother Jimmie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is Susie Littletail in there?” asked Uncle
Wiggily, looking over the fence. “Her mother
said she came over here to play, but hasn’t come
home yet. Is she there?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Uncle Wiggily,” answered Lulu, wagging
her tail wobbily like. “Susie left here
some time ago. She said she was going to run
home to supper.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s queer I didn’t meet her,” said the bunny
uncle. “But, perhaps, she might have gone
home by another path. I daresay she is all right.
I’ll walk along a little farther, and then if I don’t
see her I’ll go back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, Uncle Wiggily was going on and on,
when, all at once from behind an old stump, he
heard a sad little voice crying, and saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I’m afraid to go
home, and I’m afraid to stay here. I don’t know
what to do!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My! That sounds like trouble of the very
worst kind!” spoke Uncle Wiggily, in his jolly
voice. “I must see who it is, and if I can help
them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Uncle Wiggily started for the stump, and
then he happened to think:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, perhaps that might be the skillery-scalery
alligator with the humps on his tail, making
believe to be in trouble just to get me near
enough so he can catch me. I had better be
careful.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Uncle Wiggily carefully peeked around
the corner before going any closer to the stump,
and there, sitting down on a stone behind it in
the moonlight, was Susie Littletail, the rabbit
girl, herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Susie!” cried Uncle Wiggily.
“What are you doing here? Your mother is
looking for you, and so am I. Why don’t you
go home?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Cause I’m afraid, Uncle Wiggily,” and
Susie cried a few tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are you afraid of?” asked the bunny
uncle. “Surely not the dark. That can’t hurt
you, and besides it will soon be moonlight.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I’m not afraid of the dark, Uncle
Wiggily,” said Susie, “but I’m afraid of the
bat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The bat?” cried the bunny uncle, astonished
like.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; he’s a big bird with wings, but he has
ears and looks like a rat. I’m afraid he’ll get
tangled in my fur, or else that he’ll bite me. Oh,
there he is now!” and Susie pointed to something
black, like a bird, flying to and fro in the
darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that is a bat,” said Uncle Wiggily, “but
it will not hurt you. It is only flying around to
catch mosquitoes and other bugs that come out
mostly at night. A bat, like an owl, can see in
the dark. He won’t hurt you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, but I’m afraid,” said Susie. “I started
from the Wibblewobble house a long time ago,
to go home, but I saw the bat flying around and
I hid. I dassen’t go home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nonsense!” laughed Uncle Wiggily.
“I’ll fix it for you. I’ll play a little joke on the
bat and get him out of the way until I can lead
you home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Uncle Wiggily recited this little verse from
Mother Goose:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Bat, bat! Come under my hat,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>And I’ll give you a slice of bacon.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And when I bake,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I’ll give you a cake.</div>
      <div class='line in3'>If I am not mistaken.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Uncle Wiggily put his tall silk hat on the
ground, and, surely enough, the bat crawled
under it to see if there were any bacon there.
And, before he could come out Uncle Wiggily
hurried home with Susie, who wasn’t afraid any
more, not with the bunny uncle to hold her paw.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Uncle Wiggily, not being mistaken,
got a cake from Nurse Jane and took it back to
the bat, also getting his tall silk hat. And the
bat was very much obliged, for the cake, and he
said he never would have tangled himself in
Susie’s fur anyhow, so she need not have been
afraid.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I’m glad she’s safely home,” said the
bat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So am I,” said Uncle Wiggily.</p>

<p class='c011'>And I guess Susie was also.</p>

<p class='c011'>But if the button-hook doesn’t get tangled up
in the dog’s tail, and ride out to where the shoe-horn
is playing tunes for the rubber heels to
dance the lame duck, I’ll tell you next——</p>

<p class='c011'>Oh, but hold on, if you please. I’m not going
to tell you any more stories in this book, for it is
already quite well filled, as you can see for yourself.
So if I write any more tales they will have
to go in another big volume like this.</p>

<p class='c011'>That’s what I’ll do, if you like, and the next
book will be called, “Uncle Wiggily and His
Friends,” and will tell of the different things that
happened to the bunny uncle when he went calling
on all the animal folk that live in Woodland.
So, while I am getting that book ready, I will
say good-bye.</p>

Peetie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let’s run off and join the circus,” suggested
Peetie, as he tried to stand up on the end of his

of money.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How?” asked Jackie, scratching his nose
with his ear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, we can make money by doing tricks in
the circus,” went on Peetie. “We can jump
over the backs of elephants, climb up to the top
of the tent, and do lots of things like that. A
circus is fun!”</p>

“and I have not yet found my fortune. It is
very sad!”</p>

know where your fortune is. You are the richest
rabbit in the whole world!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My goodness me, sakes alive, and some ice
cream radishes!” Uncle Wiggily exclaimed.</p>

    <div>DADDY TAKES US TO THE CIRCUS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Mab!” cried Hal Blake, as he came
running into the house one morning. “Daddy is
going to take us to the circus!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you, Daddy?” asked the little girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said Mr. Blake. “Here are the
tickets.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, what fun we’ll have!” shouted Hal.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Won’t we!” added his sister.</p>

<p class='c011'>How Daddy Blake took the children to the
show in the big tent, and how Hal and Mab
went to sleep in one of the red wagons, and were
carried off—all that you may read in the book
called “Daddy Takes Us to the Circus.” It is
written by Howard R. Garis, who also wrote
the Bedtime book you have just read. It contains
fine pictures, and has a decorated cover.
You read, and liked, the Bedtimes, so surely
you will like the Daddy books.</p>

<p class='c011'>If your dealer does not keep them, please
send to the publishers, R. F. Fenno &amp; Company,
18 East 17th Street, New York City,
who will forward any volume on receipt of
price.</p>

<p class='c011'>Daddy Blake, on his trips with Hal and
Mab, told them things about nature and out-door
life.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
